  2              large  acorn squash, cut in half crosswise -- seeded
  1                cup  water
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/2        medium  red onion
  1                rib  celery -- chopped
  2             cloves  garlic -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
  1           teaspoon  dried oregano
  1            package  Gimme Lean Beef* -- (14 oz)
  1                cup  canned white beans -- rinsed, drained well
     1/4           cup  walnut pieces
  1         tablespoon  tamari or soy sauce
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh parsley
                        salt and fresh-ground black pepper -- to taste
     1/4           cup  grated soy cheese or mozzarella -- optional

Cut a thin slice off bottom of each squash so it sits flat.  Place 4
squash
halves, cavity side down, in a microwave-safe dish.  Add 1/2 cup water and
cover loosely with plastic wrap.  Microwave on high 12 to 15 minutes until
almost cooked throough.  Or, you can cook the squash in the oven.  Preheat
oven to 375°.  Place squash halves, cavity side down, on a baking pan with
sides lined with foil.  Add 1/2 cup water to pan and bake squash 35
minutes
until almost cooked through.  Set squash aside.
Heat oil over medium heat in a large skillet.  Add onions, celery, garlic,
thyme and oregano and saute 3 minutes until vegetables are tender.  Add
the
Gimme Lean, crumbling it with your fingers as you put it into pan so it
resembles ground beef.  Cook 2 minutes, add white beans, walnuts, tamari
and
parsley.  Combine mixture well.  Season with salt and pepper.
Turn squash cut side up and divide stuffing evenly among squash halves.
Pack stuffing in and mound top about 2 inches above squash 
surface, pressing lightly.  You can top each squash half with 1
tablespoon soy cheese or mozzarella cheese, if desired.  Place 
stuffed squash back on a baking dish, add 1/2 cup water to pan to 
prevent sticking and bake, uncovered, 10 minutes until heated through.

*Gimme Lean is a soy-based "ground beef."  It comes in a 14-ounce tube or
chub and is a substitute for raw ground beef.  It's available at natural
food stores.

Select french bread setting.

For best results, use the finest and freshest ingredients available. That

especially true for this particular recipe.

Lois' sister Anita, who loves Italian food, will tell you that this

  1         tablespoon  powdered sugar

1. Bring 2 cups cider to a boil in a large, heavy saucepan over high heat.
Cook until reduced to 1/2 cup (about 20 minutes). Reduce
heat to medium-high; stir in 1/2 cup granulated sugar. Cook 5 minutes or
until sugar dissolves and cider is thick and dark-colored,
stirring occasionally. Remove from heat; cool 1 minute. Stir in 1
tablespoon
margarine. Stir in apple; cook 15 minutes over
medium-high heat or until the liquid is absorbed, stirring frequently.
Remove from heat; cool. (If apple mixture hardens, place it
over low heat until softened).

2. Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

3. Coat a 12-cup Bundt pan with cooking spray; dust with breadcrumbs.

4. Combine 1-1/2 cups granulated sugar, 1/2 cup margarine, lemon rind, and
cream cheese in a large bowl; beat at medium speed of a
mixer until well-blended (about 5 minutes). Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating
well after each addition. Beat in 2 tablespoons lemon
juice. Lightly spoon flour into dry measuring cups; level with a knife.
Combine flour, baking soda, and salt. Add flour mixture to
sugar mixture alternately with buttermilk, beginning and ending with flour
mixture. Fold in apple mixture. Pour into prepared pan;
bake at 325 degrees for 1-1/2 hours or until a wooden pick inserted in
center comes out clean.

5. Combine 1/4 cup cider, 1/4 cup granulated sugar, 1/4 cup lemon juice,
and
vanilla; let stand until sugar dissolves, stirring
occasionally. Cool cake in pan 5 minutes, and pierce with a wooden skewer
in
several places. Pour cider mixture over cake in pan,
and let stand 10 minutes. Remove from pan, and cool completely on a wire
rack. Sift powdered sugar over top of cake.

                        Freshly ground black pepper to taste

Preheat the oven to 350. Brush off any loose pieces of skin, but otherwise
leave the onions unpeeled. Cut the onions in half from the root end
through
the stem. Place the halves, cut side down, in a glass baking dish just
large
enough to hold them comfortably. Pour the vinegar over the onions sand
cover
the dish tightly with foil. Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the onions
are
fork tender. When they are cool enough to handle, remove the skins but be
sure to leave the roots intact. Cut each onion half in half again to make
quarters. Place the onion quarters in a shallow dish, cover and
refrigerate
until serving time. Before serving, fan the layers of each onion quarter
slightly. Serve at room temperature or slightly warm, sprinkled with
pepper.

Makes 24 pieces, or 6-12 servings.

reduces the fat by 0.8 grams,  and doesn't affect the points at all, so

  4                     Idaho potatoes (10 oz each)

Scrub potatoes thoroughly and pierce all over with fork.  Line microwave
oven floor with paper towels and arrange potatoes on top, in an evenly
spaced pattern. Microwave on high 5 minutes ; turn and rearrange potatoes
and microwave 5 minutes more.  Repeat until potatoes feel nearly soft, 5-8
minutes more.  Let stand 5 minutes.  (May be done up to two days ahead;
cool to room temperature, wrap in plastic and refrigerate until ready to
use.)

When potatoes are cool enough to handle, preheat oven to 375 oF.

Cut an 'x' into the top of each potato.  Scoop out most of the potato
flesh, leaving a thick potato "shell".  Chop each potato's flesh and place
each in it's own small bowl.  Combine potato insides with add-ons as
desired (see recipes).

Arrange stuffed potatoes in medium baking pan; bake until heated through,
about 15 minutes.

Serving (1 potato) provides: 2 breads.

Note: Bake the potatoes up to 2 days ahead (or in the morning, while your
having breakfast), and just warm them in the microwave 2-3 minutes before
serving.  Chop and assemble the toppings in small bowls (buy already
shredded cheese and cooked broccoli from the salad bar to save time). 
Then, give everyone a warm potato and let them have free rein with the
toppings.

Suggested add-ons: Chopped steamed broccoli, part-skim ricotta cheese,
nonfat sour cream, thawed frozen chopped spinach, salsa, shredded cheese,
crumbled feta cheese, chopped tomatoes.

Note: Harvest's Health Champions September 2000

The tomato paste used in this recipe is a concentrated source of lycopene,
with 28 mg per 1/4 cup (50 mL) compared with 3 mg in 1 raw tomato. It is
also noteworthy that research indicates lycopene from cooked or processed
tomatoes is more readily absorbed by the body, especially if cooked with
olive oil.

  5             pounds  fish***
  4        tablespoons  olive oil
  3                     onions -- chopped
  1                     fennel bulb -- chopped
  3                     tomatoes -- chopped
  2             cloves  garlic -- crushed
  1                     bay leaf
     1/2           cup  fresh parsley -- finely snipped
     1/4      teaspoon  saffron
  2             quarts  water -- boiling (2 to 3)
                        Salt
                        Boiled potatoes -- optional

***(mix of whole fish: monkfish, swordfish, halibut,
flounder, sea bass, red snapper or whatever fish you enjoy) save
trimmings (head, bones and tails)

In large soup pot, heat olive oil on medium-high heat. Add vegetables
and sauté for 5 minutes until they begin to soften. In other pot,
bring water to boil. When water is boiling, add fish trimmings to
vegetables; add boiling water and salt. Cover and cook at a boil until
broth has reduced and thickened. (You want it to be an orangy red
color). Approximately 45 minutes.

Strain soup and discard solid pieces. This can be made in advance and
reheated later. It can also be frozen.

Boil potatoes if using and set aside. Return broth to soup pot; add
fish filets cut into chunks saffron and parsley. Bring to gentle
simmer and cook until fish is cooked all the way through.
Approximately 10 minutes. Add potatoes. Serve immediately.

You can also serve this with slices of toasted, crusty peasant bread
in the bottom of each bowl. Top with fish pieces then broth.

The trick to good fish soup is what the French refer to as "fumet de
poisson"; this is the stock made from cooking the bones and other
trimmings together with some vegetables. It is strained then used as
the base of the soup. So don't be turned off by cooking the bones, it
will enrich the soup.

  1 1/2    tablespoons  canola or corn oil
     1/3           cup  chopped onion
  1 1/3           cups  cranberry juice cocktail
     1/2           cup  dried sweetened cranberries

In a large shallow bowl, combine the soy sauce, ginger, thyme, orange
zest and pepper. Add the chops, turn to coat and set aside to
marinate for 15 minutes.

Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion
and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, 3 to 5 minutes.
Transfer the chops to the skillet, reserving the marinade. Cook the
chops, turning occasionally, until browned on both sides but not
cooked through, about 5 minutes total. Stir in the reserved marinade,
1/3 cup of the cranberry juice cocktail and the cranberries and bring
the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer just
until the pork is cooked through, 9 to 12 minutes. If the liquid
completely evaporates, add a little more cranberry juice cocktail.
Transfer the chops to a serving platter; cover to keep warm. Add the
remaining 1 cup cranberry juice cocktail to the skillet, increase the
heat to high and boil until the sauce reduces and becomes syrupy,
about 3 minutes. Be careful not to let it burn. Spoon the sauce and
cranberries over the chops and serve immediately.

Cranberries aren't just a side dish to go with turkey. This is an

  3           packages  active dry yeast
  3 1/4           cups  warm water
     1/2           cup  sugar
     1/4           cup  vegetable oil
  4          teaspoons  salt
  7 1/4           cups  all-purpose flour
  3               cups  whole wheat flour

Combine yeast, 1 C of the warm water and the sugar in a large bowl; stir
until the yeast is dissolved. Let stand until mixture is foamy, about 10
min.

Stir remaining warm water, the oil and salt into yeast mixture.

Whisk together 7 C of the all-purpose flour and the whole wheat flour in a
large bowl until combined.

Make a well in the center of the flour mixture. Add half of the yeast
liquid
to the well; stir into the flour mixture to blend. Stir in the remaining
yeast liquid until a rough mass is formed.

Turn dough out on floured surface; this is a very soft dough. Knead until
smooth and elastic, about 5 min, adding as much of the remaining 1/4C
all-purpose flour as needed to prevent sticking.

Place dough in lightly oiled bowl; turn dough in bowl so all sides are
coated. Cover bowl with towel or lightly greased waxed paper. Let rise in
a
warm place, away from drafts, for 45 - 50 min or until dough doubles in
volume.

Grease three 9 x 5 x 3" loaf pans.

Punch dough down. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Knead
lightly. Divide into thirds. Place one portion in each of the prepared
pans.
Cover with a damp towel or lightly greased waxed paper. Let rise in warm
place, away from drafts, until doubled in volume, for 30 - 45 min.

To bake, heat oven to 400F. Bake bread for 25 min or until hollow sounding
when lightly tapped. Turn loaves out onto wire racks and let cool
completely.

Broccoli needs to be cooked until quite soft.
It may also be put in a food processor to reduce
to a mushy consistency and then placed in soup.
Kathy writes: I've searched a very long time for a
good Broccoli Cream Soup recipe.  When I found this
one, I knew I'd found it.

  2           packages  active dry yeast(package)
  1 1/4           cups  warm water -- (105° to 115°)
  5 1/2           cups  bread flour -- (5-1/2-5-3/4),
                        divided
  1 1/4           cups  butternut squash -- mashed & cooked
                        (1 medium)
  3        tablespoons  molasses
  2        tablespoons  vegetable oil
  1 1/2      teaspoons  salt
  1                cup  quick-cooking oats -- plus
  2        tablespoons  quick-cooking oats
                        cooking spray
  1         tablespoon  water

Combine yeast and warm water in a 2-cup liquid measuring cup let stand 5
minutes.  Combine yeast mixture, 3 cups flour, squash, and next 3
ingredients in a large bowl; beat at medium speed of an electric mixer 2
minutes or until smooth.  Gradually stir in 1 cup oats and 2 cups flour to
make a moderately still dough.

Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead until smooth and
elastic (about 10 minutes), adding enough of remaining flour, 1/4 cup at a
time, to keep dough from sticking to hands.  Place dough in a large bowl
coated with cooking spray, turning to coat top.  Cover and let rise in a
warm place (85°), free from drafts, 35 minutes or until doubled in bulk.

Punch dough down; divide in half. Turn 1 portion out onto work surface;
knead 4 or 5 times.  Roll into a 14 x 7 inch rectangle.  Roll up, staring
at
short side, pressing firmly to eliminate air pockets; pinch ends to seal.
Place dough, seam side down, in an 8-1/2 x 4 -1/2 inch loafpan coated with
cooking spray and sprinkle with 1 1/2 teaspoons oats.  Repeat procedure
with
remaining dough and 1 1/2 teaspoons oats.

Brush loaves evenly with 1 tablespoon water, and sprinkle evenly with
remaining 1 tablespoon oats.  Cover and let rise in a warm place free from
drafts, 25 minutes or until doubled in bulk.  Bake at 350° for 35 minutes
or
until loaves sound hollow when tapped.  Remove from pans immediately; cool
on wire rack.

Yield:  2 loaves or 16 (1/2 inch) slices per loaf.

     1/2           cup  Cheddar cheese -- shredded
                        **Corn Muffins**
  1                     egg
  1 1/2           cups  Original Bisquick
     3/4           cup  yellow cornmeal
     1/3           cup  sugar
     2/3           cup  milk

3-quart saucpan. Heat to boiling; reduce heat to low. Simmer 10 minutes,
stirring occasionally.

For each serving, pour chili over 1 or 2 muffins. Sprinkle with cheese. 6
servings.

Corn Muffins: Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Grease bottoms only of 12 medium
muffin cups, 2 1/2x1 1/4 inches, or line with paper baking cups. Beat egg
slightly; stir in remaining ingredients just until moistened. Fill muffin
cups 3/4 full. Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown.

Success Hint: Warm leftover Corn Muffins in the microwave and serve with
honey for another meal.

square pan, 8x8x2 inches. Make batter as directed; spread in pan. Bake 20
to
25 minutes or until golden brown.

     1/2           cup  oil
                        - (or 1 stick butter melted)
  2                     eggs
  1                cup  sugar
  1                cup  solid pack pumpkin
     2/3           cup  whole berry jellied cranberry sauce
  1 1/2           cups  flour
  1           teaspoon  baking soda
  1 1/2      teaspoons  cinnamon
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  nutmeg
     1/8      teaspoon  cloves

Combine all ingredients in food processor and process for five seconds.
Scrape down and pulse to combine 1 or 2 times. Do not overprocess. If you
don't have a processor, you could probably just stir this up by hand.

Spray with Pam (or lightly but thoroughly grease) an 8" loaf pan. Spoon
batter into pan. Bake for approx. 1 hr. and ten minutes in 350 F oven. You
may need to tent foil over the top after it has been in the oven for about
30 minutes to keep it from getting too dark before the bread is done. Test

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        Butter for the pans
                        **cranberry-orange mixture**
  1 1/2           cups  fresh cranberries (may substitute frozen -- thawed)
                        --cranberries
     1/2           cup  sweet (not Seville) orange marmalade*
     1/3           cup  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  finely grated orange zest
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
                        Generous 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
                        **batter**
  2 1/4           cups  flour
  2 1/4      teaspoons  baking powder
                        Generous 1/2 teaspoon salt
  6        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- at room temperature
     2/3           cup  plus 1 tablespoon sugar
  1              large  egg
  1 1/4      teaspoons  vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  finely grated orange zest
  1                cup  low-fat or whole milk

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Generously butter 12 standard-sized
muffin cups or line them with paper liners.

For the cranberry-orange mixture: In a blender or a food processor,
combine the cranberries, marmalade, sugar, orange zest, cinnamon and
cardamom and process until the cranberries are coarsely chopped.
Scrape the mixture into a small saucepan and heat over medium heat
until the mixture comes to a boil, about 5 minutes. Or scrape the
mixture into a large microwave-safe bowl, cover loosely with wax
paper and microwave on full power, stopping to stir every 2 minutes,
until the mixture is bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes. Set aside to cool
slightly.

For the batter: In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and
salt. Set aside.

In a medium bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed, beat
together the butter and 2/3 cup of the sugar until combined. Add the
egg and mix until light and fluffy, about 1 minute. Add the vanilla
and orange zest and mix until smooth. Using a spoon, stir 1/2 of the
flour mixture into the bowl, then stir in the milk, finally stir in
the remaining flour mixture, and mix just until the batter is smooth.

Transfer 1/4 cup of the batter to the cranberry-orange mixture and
mix to combine; set aside.

Transfer 1/3 of the plain batter to a small bowl; set aside. Divide
the remaining plain batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups, a
scant 2 tablespoons per cup. Then divide the cranberry batter evenly
among the muffin cups, 1 to 2 tablespoons per cup. Top each muffin
with a spoonful of the reserved plain batter. If desired, swirl the
batter and cranberry filling together lightly with a knife or a
toothpick. Sprinkle the muffins with the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar.

Bake the muffins in the preheated oven for 13 to 15 minutes, until
they are barely golden on top and springy to the touch. Transfer the
muffin tin to a wire rack to cool for about 3 minutes. Using a knife,
loosen the muffins from the tin and transfer them to a wire rack to
cool completely.

* Note: Marmalade made from Seville oranges will be too bitter for this
recipe.

These muffins are swirled with a bright cranberry filling. It's best

                        **FOR THE DRESSING**
  2               cups  mayonnaise
  2        tablespoons  cider vinegar
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  garlic -- minced

  5              large  carrots (1 1/2 lbs) -- peeled and shredded
  1               head  green cabbage (about 2 lbs) -- shredded (about 12
                        cups)

To make dressing: In a small bowl, mix together the mayonnaise, vinegar,
sugar, garlic, pepper and salt. Set aside.

To make cabbage mix: In a large bowl, toss the carrots and cabbage.
Immediately pour the dressing over the cabbage mix and toss until all of
the
vegetables are well coated. Cover the bowl and refrigerate until the
vegetables wilt just a little, about 15 minutes. (The flavors blend even
better if you let the slaw marinate in the refrigerator for about 1 hour.)

Toss again before serving to redistribute any dressing that has settled in
the bottom of the bowl.

Makes 3 quarts.

My whole family loves this and I love the fact that I can prepare it in
the
morning before work and supper is ready when I come
home. All I need to do is add a salad and some Minute Rice!

SOURCE;  More Bread Machine Magic by Linda Rehberg and Lois Conway,
copyright 1997, ISBN #0-312-16935-3. MM format by Ursula R. Taylor.

Note just above the recipe says that this bread was inspired by fond
memories of Linda's Dad sitting at the table pouring milk over his
rice and putting cinnamon & sugar on top. 

Also notes to watch dough ball as it varies each time you make it and 
that if you use freshly cooked rice you will need to add extra liquid. 

1. Place all ingredients except raisins in bread pan, using the least 
amount of liquid listed in the recipe. Select Light Crust setting and
Raisin/Nut cycle. Press start.

2. Observe the dough as it kneads.  After 5 to 10 minutes, if it appears 
dry & stiff or if your machine sounds as if it's straining to knead it,
add
more liquid 1 tbsp. at a time until dough forms a smooth, soft, pliable
ball
that is slightly tacky to the touch. 

3.  At the beep, add the raisins. 

4. After the baking cycle ends, remove bread from pan, place on cake
rack, & allow to cool 1 hour before slicing. 

CRUST: Light -- BAKE CYCLE: Raisin/nut ~- OPTIONAL BAKE

  2               cups  water or vegetable broth
  2        tablespoons  olive oil -- divided
  2             medium  onions -- sliced 1/2" thick

water
left in the pan).

Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat and
saute
onions 6 to 8 minutes, stirring occasionally until golden brown and
carmelized.  Sprinkle with water, if necessary, to prevent sticking. 
Remove
from pan and set aside.

In same pan, place 1 tablespoon olive oil and heat over medium heat.  Add
celery, carrot, portobello mushrooms, leek, apples and thyme; saute 2
minutes.

Add sauteed vegetables to barley with their cooking liquid.  Then add 2
cups
water or vegetable broth; season with salt and pepper.
Place mixture in a 2-1/2 quart casserole, spread sauteed onions over top,
cover loosely with foil and bake in a 375° oven 25 to 30 minutes until
barley is fluffy and cooked and vegetables are tender.  If desired,
uncover and
place under broiler 5 minutes to crisp crust.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  6                     Egg whites
  1                 pn  Cream of tartar
  1 3/4              c  Sugar -- (divided use)
  1                 tb  Unsalted butter
  3                  c  Blueberries
     1/4             c  Brandy
     1/2             t  Ground cinnamon
     1/4             t  Ground nutmeg
     1/4             t  Ground ginger
     3/4             c  Heavy cream -- whipped

  Preheat oven to 250 F. Whip egg on high speed until
  foamy. Add cream of tartar and mix well. With machine
  running, add 1/4 cups sugar, about 1 tablespoon at a
  time. Once incorporated, continue to mix until whites
  are shiny and hold a stiff peak.

  Place meringue in a piping bag fitted with a large
  star tip. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
  Pipe 8 (4-inch) circles onto the parchment. If you
  like, you can draw circles on the paper to ensure they
  are even. Bake about 1 hour or until meringues are dry
  and crisp. Turn oven off and allow meringues to cool
  in oven. Remove and set aside.

  Heat butter in: a large sauté pan until bubbling. Add
  blueberries and sauté until they start to soften, 2 to
  3 minutes. Add remaining 1/2 cup sugar and brandy and
  cook until sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes. Add
  cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger and mix with berries.
  Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.

  To assemble, place one of the meringue layers on each
  of 4 plates. Top with about 1/3 cup of the blueberry
  filling, using about half of it in all. Add a bit of
  the whipped cream, then top with another meringue
  layer. Finish with more filling, and then the last of
  the whipped cream. Serve immediately. Makes 4 servings.

NOTES : Selection:
        Look for robust ginger roots with a spicy fragrance.  Any sign of
        cracking or withering indicates old age.  Unpeeled ginger may be
        kept in the refrigerator for 3 weeks.  Peeled ginger can be placed
        in a jar of sherry and kept refrigerated for 3 months.
        
        Preparation:
        Gently peel the thin beige skin from the root.  The flesh beneath

                 GREEN BEAN AND VEGETABLE RAGOUT (3 PTS)

Recipe By     :
Serving Size  : 1     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : 

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     carrots
  4                     parsnips
  1               bulb  fennel
  1              pound  Blue Lake beans
  1         tablespoon  chopped garlic
  1         tablespoon  chopped thyme
  1         tablespoon  chopped parsley
  2        tablespoons  olive oil
  2          teaspoons  salt
  1           teaspoon  pepper
  4        tablespoons  butter -- (1/2 stick)

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Start a pot of boiling water big
enough to hold twice the amount of beans. Season the water heavily
with salt.

2. Peel carrots and parsnips. Remove just the stalk end of the green
beans by snapping or cutting them off. Cut the carrot, parsnips and
fennel into batons (french-fry cut), about the same size as the green
beans.

3. Toss the carrots, parsnips and fennel with the chopped garlic,
thyme, parsley, olive oil, salt and pepper. Spread on a cookie sheet
or roasting pan and cook in the oven for 10-15 minutes, or until just
tender.

8. During the last two minutes the vegetables are roasting, drop the
green beans into the salted boiling water and cook for two minutes
and strain. (You can also pre-roast the veggies and blanch the beans
ahead, then reheat them all together in the oven 5 to 10 minutes
before serving time.)

9. Remove vegetables from oven and place in a bowl. Add beans and
toss with butter. Adjust seasoning to taste and serve.

Serves 8-12

For ease and consistency, Frank Palmer, executive chef at the
Lafayette Park Hotel, recommends using a mandoline to cut the veggies.

  5        tablespoons  unsalted butter -- cut into bits

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Lightly coat a 9-by-13-inch baking
dish with the spray oil.

For the filling: In a large bowl, combine the sugar, cinnamon,
allspice and cranberries. Add the apples, pears, bread and cranberry
juice cocktail and toss to coat. Spread the mixture evenly in the
prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with the butter. Bake for 10 minutes.

For the topping: In a food processor or a blender, combine the flour,
sugar and cinnamon and pulse to mix. Sprinkle the butter over the
mixture and process until well blended, about 1 minute.
Alternatively, in a bowl, stir together flour, sugar and cinnamon.
With fingers or forks, work butter into dry ingredients until mixture
is well blended.

Sprinkle the topping mixture evenly over the fruit mixture. Return
the dish to the oven and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until nicely
browned and crisp on top. Transfer the dish to a wire rack to cool
for at least 15 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Betty recipes started turning up in 19th-century America. Early
versions usually called for several layers of fruit and bread cubes
and were rather puddinglike. I prefer to spread the fruit and bread
in a single layer and bake in a flat dish, which, while less
traditional, produces a crispier texture.

NOTES : We found that when rounded out with bread and some steamed
vegetables, this generous portion of creamy seafood could easily make a
main
dish. The original dish called for two cups of mayonnaise; we substituted
nonfat mayo and part-skim ricotta cheese. We also compensated by doubling
up
on the veggies. Our final touch: taking the Parmesan cheese out of the
dish
and sprinkling it on top instead...its flavor came through in every bite.
(Note: If Dungeness crab is unavailable, you can also substitute rinsed
canned lump crabmeat or surimi.)

     1/2           cup  fine dry seasoned bread crumbs
  1              pound  ground turkey breast (see note)
     2/3           cup  reduced-fat spaghetti sauce
  2        tablespoons  grated Parmesan cheese

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, stir together the egg
whites, garlic, basil, salt, rosemary and red pepper. Then stir in the
apples, onions and bread crumbs. Add the turkey and mix until well
combined. Spray a 7 1/2-by-3 1/2-by-2-inch or 8-by-4-by-2-inch loaf pan
with no-stick spray. Pat the turkey mixture into the pan. Bake for 15
minutes. Spread the spaghetti sauce over the top of the turkey. Bake about
25 minutes more or until the turkey is no longer pink. Let stand for 5
minutes. Transfer the loaf to a serving plate. Sprinkle the Parmesan
cheese over the top. Slice and serve. 

Note: To make sure you're buying the leanest ground turkey available,
check the label. Look for products made with only turkey breast meat. Many
ground turkey products contain the dark meat and the fatty skin.

         Lime-Marinated Snapper with Tomato-Caper Sauce (2.5 PTS)

Recipe By     :
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:30
Categories    : 

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4            fillets  red snapper -- (1 1/2 pounds)
                        Salt
                        Ground white pepper
     1/4           cup  fresh lime juice -- (from 1 large lime)
  1             medium  onion -- sliced thin
  3             medium  tomatoes -- peeled, seeded, and 
     1/4           cup  green chiles -- minced
  1         tablespoon  capers -- drained
  4             ounces  roasted red peppers -- sliced thin

TO PREPARE: Place the snapper fillets in a large nonreactive baking dish;
sprinkle the fillets with 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon white pepper,
and lime juice. Let them stand 15 minutes.

TO COOK: Meanwhile, bring 1/4 cup water to boil in a large skillet. Add
onions; cover and simmer until softened, about 7 minutes.

Add the tomatoes, minced green chiles, capers, and 1/4 cup of the roasted
red peppers; cover and simmer until the tomatoes release their juice and
flavors blend, about 7 minutes. Add red snapper fillets; cover and simmer
5 minutes. Turn fillets and simmer, uncovered, until fillets are opaque
throughout, about 4 minutes longer.

TO SERVE: Transfer a red snapper fillet to each warm dinner plate. Spoon
some sauce over each portion and garnish with remaining roasted red
peppers. Serve immediately.

Marinating red snapper fillets in lime juice enhances their flavor without
adding calories. A salad of curly endive and thinly sliced fennel rounds
out this light, Mediterranean-style fish dinner.

To make turkey:  Preheat oven to 400°.  Place turkey breast on a rack in a
roasting pan and sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Roast 15 minutes, then
reduce heat to 350° and roast another 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine maple syrup, vanilla, nutmeg and allspice in a saucepan
and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer 3 to 5 minutes until liquid
is
reduced by about one-fourth.  After first 45 minutes of roasting, brush
turkey with glaze.  Roast 15 minutes more and brush with glaze.  Roast 10
minutes more and glaze again.  Roast 5 minutes, brush with remaining
glaze,
and continue roasting 5 to 10 minutes until an instant-read thermometer
inserted in the thickest part registers 180°.

To make stuffing:  Meanwhile, spray a 3-quart baking dish with no-stick
cooking spray.  Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add
onions, celery, carrot and garlic, and saute 7 to 8 minutes until
vegetables begin
to soften.  Stir in apples and cook 3 minutes.  Add white and shiitake
mushrooms and 1/4 teaspoon salt; saute 6 minutes until mushrooms begin to
give off
their liquid and soften.  Stir in sherry, sage and thyme; cook 2 to 3
minutes until liquid has evaporated.  Remove from heat.
Combine vegetable mixture, bread cubes, broth, remaining 1/2 teaspoon
salt,
and pepper in a large bowl.  Toss well to combine and transfer to baking
dish.  Cover dish with foil.  After turkey has roasted 1 hour, place
stuffing in oven and bake 15 minutes.  Remove foil and bake 15 to 20
minutes until
stuffing is heated through and crisp on top. 

 Makes 12 servings of turkey and stuffing.

  1         tablespoon  canola oil
  3                     pears -- peeled, cored, and
                        --diced
  1           teaspoon  sugar
  3                     plum tomatoes -- roasted and diced
  1              small  poblano chile -- roasted, peeled,
                        --seeded, and diced
  1              small  red bell pepper -- roasted, peeled,
                        --seeded and diced (see note)
  1         tablespoon  apple cider vinegar

1. Heat the oil in a pan and sauté the pears with the sugar over
medium-low heat for 2 minutes. Transfer to a mixing bowl. Thoroughly
combine with all the remaining ingredients.

Note: To roast peppers: Position the broiler rack about 4 inches from
the heat source and preheat the broiler. Place a sheet of foil on a
baking sheet and place the pepper on it. Broil, turning with tongs as
it blackens, until evenly charred, about 20 minutes. Fold the foil up
over the pepper and seal. As it cools, the skin will loosen.

Makes 2 cups

This salsa works well with poultry. If you like olives, try adding 8
pitted and sliced kalamatas to the mix.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4           cup  onion -- chopped
  1           teaspoon  butter
     1/4           cup  dry sherry
  1                cup  celery -- chopped
  2               cups  red potatoes -- diced
  1                     bay leaf
  2               cups  fat-free chicken broth
  2               cups  tomatoes -- chopped
  1 1/2           cups  corn kernels
  1 1/2           cups  skim milk
     1/2           cup  parsley -- chopped
                        ground pepper (optional)

To lower the calories in the soup, nonfat milk and potato puree replace
the 
rich cream base used in traditional recipes. This soup freezes
beautifully, so 
make a double batch, especially when corn is at its peak.

In a large stockpot over med-high heat, saute onion in butter and sherry
until 
soft but not browned. Add celery and potatoes and saute for 2 min. Crush
bay 
leaf and wrap in cheesecloth or place in a tea ball. Add stock and bay
leaf to 
soup and bring to a boil.

Lower heat to simmer and cook, covered, until potatoes are tender (20
min). 
Remove bay leaf and discard. Place 2 C of the soup in a blender and puree.

Return to pot. Add tomatoes, corn, and milk, and bring to a boil again.
Lower heat and simmer for 5 min. Add parsley, taste for seasoning, and add

pepper (if desired).

Measure carefully, adding ingredients in bread machine pan in the
order recommended by the manufacturer - except cherries, raisins or
currants and almonds.  Select Sweet or Basic/White cycle.  Use Light
or Medium crust color.  Add red and green candied cherries, raisins
or currants, and almonds at the raisin/nut cycle or 5 minutes before
last kneading cycle ends.  The dough becomes VERY SOFT and WET in
appearance at this point! DO NOT add flour, as the bread will become
tough.

Remove baked bread from pan and cool on wire rack.

NOTES : Selection:
        Hachiya persimmons are elongated, pointy persimmons, which are
        usually astringent until they are so ripe they are squishy.  The
        fuyu persimmon is very sweet, even when firm and crisp.  Round and
        shaped like a tomato, they are firm enough to be eaten like an
        apple.
        
        Preparation:
        Persimmons are luscious raw, and rinsing them is all you need to
        do.  There are a few large seeds, which can be easily removed. 
        Peel and slice the firmer fuyu persimmons for fruit salads.  For
        the softer hachiya, cut off the top and eat the pulp out of hand
        with a spoon.

     3/4           cup  chopped salted peanuts

  1           teaspoon  pure vanilla extract

Grease a 9-inch-square baking pan and set aside.  In a large bowl, mix
together rice cereal, oats and peanuts; set aside.
Place peanut butter, brown sugar and corn syrup in a small saucepan over
low
heat.  Stir constantly until mixture is smooth and just starts to boil.
Stir in vanilla and pour over cereal mixture.  Toss gently to mix well.
Transfer to prepared pan and press evenly.  Let cool completely, then cut
into 12 bars.  They will be approximately 1 1/2-by-4 1/2-inches each. 
Wrap
bars individually in plastic wrap or individual sandwich bags before
storing
them in an airtight container.  (This keeps them from sticking together as
they can sometimes do in our humid weather.)

           Prune Banana Muffins with Cranberry Spread (4.5 PTS)

Serving Size  : 12    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : 

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        **MUFFINS**
  1                cup  mashed bananas
     1/2           cup  plain nonfat yogurt
     1/2           cup  bran
  1 1/2           cups  whole wheat flour
  1           teaspoon  baking powder
     1/2      teaspoon  baking soda
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
     1/2           cup  prunes -- pitted and chopped
     1/2           cup  molasses
     1/4           cup  oil
     1/4           cup  fat-free egg substitute
                        **CRANBERRY SPREAD**
  12            ounces  cranberries -- whole
  1                cup  apple juice
     1/2           cup  maple syrup
     1/2           cup  raisins

MUFFINS: In a SMALL bowl mix the bananas, yogurt and bran. In a LARGE bowl
sift together the flour, baking power, baking soda, and cinnamon. Add
coarsely chopped prunes and toss to coat. In another small bowl, combine
the
molasses, oil and eggs. Pour the egg mixture and then the banana mixture
into the flour mixture. Carefully fold together with a rubber spatula
until
just blended; do no over mix.

Coat 12 muffin cups with no-stick spray. Spoon the batter into the cups,
filling them about two-thirds. Bake at 400F for 20 to 25 minutes, or until
the edges pull away from the sides of the cups.

CRANBERRY SPREAD: In a 2 quart saucepan combine the cranberries, juice,
syrup and raisins. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to
medium
and cook until the mixture is thickened and reduced, about 15 minutes.
Stir
the mixture occasionally as it cooks and press on the cranberries to break
them (the way we would cherry pie filling). Spoon the spread into small
jars. Cool, cover and refrigerate. Makes 2 cups.

Muffin variation: other dried fruits, such as apricots, peaches, currants.
(no points figured for variation)

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4 1/2           cups  nonfat milk
  2 1/4           cups  egg substitute
  2               cups  pumpkin puree
     1/2           cup  white sugar
  1           teaspoon  pumpkin pie spice

Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Whisk all ingredients together making sure
that
sugar is dissolved before you begin baking. Spray inside of individual
ramekins or custard cups with nonstick spray and fill each 3/4 full with
custard mixture. Place ramekins in a larger baking dish that will allow
for
water to come at least halfway up the side of the ramekins. Fill large
baking dish with boiling water and cover the top of the ramekins with
parchment paper sprayed with nonstick spray. Place two utensils or metal
skewers on top of the parchment to keep from curling off in the oven. Bake
for 25-30 minutes before checking with a skewer or fork tines to see if
custard is cooked. The custard will continue to cook some as it cools so
don't over cook. Serve with fresh berries, papaya or other fresh fruit.

  1                cup  orange juice
  4          teaspoons  cornstarch
  22            ounces  mandarin orange sections -- drained

  1                cup  strawberries -- sliced

Satisfy your chocolate craving and maintain your goal of reduced fat with
this rich creamy cheesecake.  A dusting of powdered sugar through a
stencil
design makes a nice garnish if you choose not to use the fruit topping.

FOOD PROCESSOR DIRECTIONS: Heat oven to 325 degrees F. Spray 9-inch pie
pan
thoroughly (6 to 8 seconds) with nonstick cooking spray. In small bowl,
combine graham cracker crumbs and sugar; mix well. Add crumb mixture to
pan;
tilt pan to coat evenly. (Avoid tapping pan, which will loosen crumbs from
sides.)  Gently
press crumbs against sides and bottom of pan. (Crumbs will stick loosely
together but will be held firmly in place when filling is added.)  Set
aside.

In food processor bowl with metal blade, process ricotta cheese until
smooth.
* Add 1 cup sugar, cocoa and cream cheese; process until smooth. Add egg
product, milk and vanilla; process until blended. Carefully pour mixture
into crust.

Bake at 325 degrees F. for 45 to 55 minutes or until edges are firm.
(Center
will be soft.)  Turn oven off; let cheesecake stand in oven 30 minutes
with
door open at least 4 inches. Remove from oven; cool to room temperature on
wire rack. Cover; refrigerate at least 2 hours.

To prepare topping, in small saucepan cook orange juice and cornstarch
over
medium heat until mixture thickens and comes to a full boil. Remove from
heat; cool to room temperature. Fold in orange sections, kiwifruit and
strawberries. Serve over cheesecake. Store in refrigerator.

TIP: * Ricotta cheese can be pureed in blender container in 2 batches,
using
half of the milk for each batch.  Transfer pureed ricotta mixture to large
bowl.  Continue as directed using an electric mixer.

small bowl, and stir to mix well. Set aside. Combine flours, sugar,
baking soda and cinnamon in a medium-sized bowl, and stir to mix
well. Stir in the apple juice, sour cream, and egg white. Fold in the
apples and raisins. Coat a 9-inch round pan with nonstick cooking
spray and spread the batter evenly in the pan. Sprinkle the topping
over the batter and bake at 350 F for 30 to 33 minutes, or just until
a wooden toothpick inserted in center of cake comes out clean. Cool

minutes, turning twice, or until tender when pierced with a knife. Remove
and allow to stand for 5 minutes to cool. Carefully cut the squash in
halve lengthwise. Scoop out and discard the seeds and pulp. With a fork,
scrape the squash strands into a large bowl.

  1              large  spaghetti squash
  3        tablespoons  oil
  1         tablespoon  red wine vinegar
     1/2      teaspoon  sugar
     1/4      teaspoon  nutmeg
  1         tablespoon  chopped chives

                        Salt -- to taste
                        Black pepper -- to taste

Cook spaghetti squash: microwave on HIGH for 12 - 15 minutes by piercing
with a fork; or boil it for 30 minutes. Let stand until cool, then cut off
1/3rd lengthwise, leaving remaining 2/3rds to form a boat into which to
put the finished salad. (Before slicing, roll it on its side to determine
best upright position.)

Remove the "spaghetti strands" from both pieces of squash (a spoon usually
helps) and toss in bowl with other ingredients. Replace in shell. Serve at
room temperature or slightly cool. Best made earlier in the day so the
flavors have a chance to mix.

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. To make caramel: Put the butter,
sugar, wine and spices in a saucepan and heat just until the butter
is melted, and stir.

2. Place the pears upright in a baking dish (taking a small slice
from their bottom side will help them sit straight). Pour the caramel
over each pear. Bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes, basting several
times. The pears are done when a knife pierces them easily.

3. Before serving, pour the juice into a saucepan and cook for
several minutes until thickened. Pour the juice over the pears and
serve.

                        ***MERINGUE***
  6                     egg whites
     1/2      teaspoon  cream of tartar
  1               dash  salt
  1 1/2           cups  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  vanilla
                        ***FILLING***
  3               cups  half and half
  1               pkg.  instant vanilla pudding mix -- (5 1/4 ounce)
  1           teaspoon  almond extract
                        ***TOPPING***
  3               cups  strawberries -- halved
  2        tablespoons  currant jelly -- optional

For a perfect meringue, be sure egg whites are at room temperature and the
bowl and beaters are completely free of fat. Store baked dessert meringues
at room temperature for up to 2 days or freeze them for up to one month.

Heat oven to 275 degrees F. Line 2 cookie sheets with brown or parchment
paper. In large bowl, beat egg whites, cream of tartar and salt until
frothy. Gradually add sugar, beating continuously until stiff peaks form,
about 10 minutes. Beat in vanilla. Spoon half of meringue mixture onto
each
paper-lined sheet. Shape into two 9-inch circles, building up sides
slightly
with back of spoon.

Bake at 275 degrees F. for 1 1/4 hours. Turn oven off; leave meringues in
oven with door closed for 2 hours. Remove from oven; cool completely.
Remove
meringues from paper.

To prepare filling, in medium bowl combine half and half and pudding mix;
beat at low speed 1 minute. Stir in almond extract.

To assemble, place 1 meringue on large serving plate. Spread filling to
edges of meringue; top with remaining meringue. Arrange strawberries over
top. In small saucepan, melt jelly over low heat; brush over berries.
Refrigerate at least 2 hours before serving to soften meringues.

TIP: Meringues can be made 1 or 2 days ahead.  Cover loosely; store at
room
temperature.  Fill and top with berries; refrigerate at least 2 hours
before
serving to soften meringues.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        ***MERINGUE***
  3                     egg whites
     1/4      teaspoon  cream of tartar
     1/2      teaspoon  cinnamon
     3/4           cup  sugar
                        ***FILLING***
     2/3           cup  sugar
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  8             ounces  crushed pineapple -- drain & reserve
                        liquid
     2/3           cup  orange juice
  2                     egg yolks -- slightly beaten
  11            ounces  mandarin orange sections -- drained
  1             medium  banana -- sliced
     1/2           cup  macadamia nuts
  2        tablespoons  coconut

Even before the rotary egg beater was invented in 1870, meringue tarts and
crusts were popular.  For a successful meringue crust, it is important to
gradually beat in the sugar and allow the standing time in the oven after
baking.

Heat oven to 275 degrees F. Line cookie sheet with brown or parchment
paper.
Draw 10-inch circle on paper. In small bowl, beat egg whites, cream of
tartar and cinnamon until foamy. Gradually add 3/4 cup sugar 2 tablespoons
at a time, beating continuously until sugar is dissolved and stiff peaks
form. DO NOT UNDERBEAT. Spread 2/3 of meringue onto 10-inch circle on
paper-lined cookie sheet. Using remaining 1/3 of meringue, spoon or pipe
dollops around edge of circle.

Bake at 275 degrees F. for 30 minutes. Turn oven off; let meringue set in
oven with door closed for 1 hour. Remove from oven; cool completely.
Carefully remove paper from meringue shell; place shell on serving plate.

In medium saucepan, combine 2/3 cup sugar and cornstarch. Stir in reserved
pineapple liquid, orange juice and egg yolks. Cook over medium heat until
mixture boils and thickens, stirring constantly. Boil 1 minute; remove
from
heat. Fold in pineapple, orange segments and banana slices. Spoon into
meringue shell. Cool. Cover with plastic wrap; refrigerate 1 to 2 hours.
To
serve, sprinkle with nuts and coconut; cut into wedges.

TIP: The meringue shell can be made a day ahead.  Cover loosely; store at
room temperature.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12             large  Swiss chard leaves
                        Filling:
  1                cup  onions -- finely chopped
  4             cloves  garlic -- minced
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
  1              stalk  celery -- chopped
     1/2      teaspoon  dried marjoram
  1                cup  mushrooms -- sliced - (4 oz)
  1         tablespoon  dry sherry
  1         tablespoon  soy sauce
     1/2      teaspoon  dried dill
  1              pinch  thyme
  1                cup  cooked bulgur
  1                cup  cooked brown rice
  2        tablespoons  currants
  1         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  2              large  tomatoes -- sliced --optional
  1                cup  tomato juice -- optional
                        nonfat sour cream or yogurt -- optional

Remove the stems and tough ribs from the Swiss chard. Blanch the leaves in

boiling water for 3-4 minutes, until pliable.

To prepare the filling: saute the onions and garlic in the oil for 3
minutes. 
Add the celery and marjoram, cover, and cook on medium heat for 5-10 
minutes,until the vegetables are softened. Stir in the mushrooms, sherry,
soy 
sauce, dill and thyme and simmer until the mushrooms are tender and juicy.

Remove from the heat and stir in the bulgur, rice, currants, and lemon
juice.

Preheat the oven to 350oF.

Prepare a 9 x 12 inch baking dish with a very light coating of oil or
cooking 
spray. Cover the bottom with the tomato slices, and set aside.

Place 1/4 cup of the filling in the center of each leaf. Fold the sides of
each 
leaf toward the center, and then roll it up form the stem end to the tip
to 
form a neat little package. Place the rolls, seam side down, pour the
tomato 
juice over them, and cover tightly with foil. Bake for 30 - 40 minutes
until 
heated through. Serve the rolls with some pan juices spooned over the top,
and 
garnish with the sour cream.

Selection and storage:  Swiss chard is available spring through early

Preparation:  Wash Swiss chard thoroughly by dunking it in a sink filled
with water until it is free from any sand.  Young chard can be used in
cooking as-is.  With more mature chard, separate the leaves from the
stems.  Handle the ribs as you would celery, trimming and peeling any
larger ribs nd strings.

1.  In a frying pan, cook bacon until crisp, then drain on paper towels
and pour oil from pan.

2.  Cook chard in the pan until it begins to wilt.  Add garlic and cook,
stirring, for 2 minutes.

3.  Place chard with bacon in a baking dish and sprinkle with Parmesan
cheese.

4.  Bake in a 350º oven until the top is golden brown.

NOTES : You won't believe how juicy and flavorful this golden bird is
thanks
to basting and high oven temperatures. The vanilla-tarragon combination is
so subtle; no one will guess your secret ingredient. They'll just think
it's
the best chicken they've ever had!

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8                     Jewel yams -- 6 to 8 ounces each
  1                     red onion -- peeled and minced
  1             medium  celery root -- peeled and chopped
                        --fine
  2        tablespoons  sweet butter
     1/2           cup  grated pecorino and parmesan (or use 1
                        --cup of either)
  1              Pinch  nutmeg
                        Salt and pepper to taste

1. Wash and dry the yams. Rub with a little salad oil, sprinkle with
salt and bake at 350 degrees for one hour. Cool for 20 minutes. Cut a
1/4-inch lengthwise strip off each yam.

2. Using a small soup spoon, scoop out the yam meat, taking care not
to puncture the skin. Mash the cooked yam in a bowl, placing the yam
skins on a cookie sheet.

3. In a large sauté pan, melt the butter and sauté the onion and
celery root for 3 to 5 minutes over low heat until the vegetables are
tender. Add to the mashed yam and blend with cheeses (reserve some of
the parmesan to top the stuffed yams). Season the mixture with
nutmeg, salt and pepper. Taste.

4. Stuff the yam skins, packing fairly well and top with reserved
parmesan. This part of the preparation may be done a day in advance.
To serve, bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes, or until piping hot.

Choosing the right size and shape yams is the key step for this
recipe, says Josephine Segraves of Mudd's Restaurant. Jewel yams are
best suited; choose ones that are cylindrical.

  1           teaspoon  vanilla

flavored chips or coconut, making each half different.  Glaze one half of
the bars and leave the other plain, or cut one side into squares and the

than just one!

Heat oven to 350 degrees F. In large bowl; beat sugar and margarine until
light and fluffy. Add vanilla and egg; blend well. Lightly spoon flour
into
measuring cup; level off. Stir in flour; mix well. Spread dough into
ungreased 15x10x1-inch baking pan. Sprinkle half of dough with fruit cake
mix and other half with chocolate chips and pecans; press lightly into
dough.

Bake at 350 degrees F. for 25 to 30 minutes or until edges are lightly
browned. Cool completely.

In small bowl, combine powdered sugar and enough milk for desired
drizzling
consistency; blend until smooth. Drizzle over cooled bars. Let stand until
set; cut into bars. Makes 48 bars.

HIGH ALTITUDE - Above 3500 Feet:  Increase flour to 2 1/4 cups. Bake as
directed.

Categories    : 

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        CRUST:
  1                cup  all-purpose flour
  1         tablespoon  sugar
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
  1         tablespoon  butter
  3        tablespoons  vegetable oil -- preferably canola
                        FILLING:
  3                     lemons
  2               cups  sugar
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
  2              large  eggs
  3              large  egg whites
                        confectioner's sugar -- for dusting

*To make crust:  Lightly oil a 9-inch pie plate or coat with nonstick
cooking spray.

In a medium-sized bowl, stir together flour, sugar and salt.  In a small
saucepan over low heat, melt butter, swirling it in the pan for about 30
seconds, until light brown.  Pour into a small bowl and let cool.  Stir in
oil.  Using a fork, slowly stir the butter-oil mixture into the flour
until
the mixture is crumbly.  Gradually stir in enough ice water (1 to 2 Tbsp.)
so that the dough will hold together.  Press the dough into a flattened
disk.

Place two 14-inch sheets of plastic wrap overlapping by 2 inches on the
work
surface.  Place pastry in the center and cover with two more overlapping
sheets of plastic wrap.  With a rolling pin, roll the dough into a circle
about 12 inches in diameter.  Remove the top sheets and invert the dough
over the prepared pie plate.  Carefully peel away the remaining plastic
wrap.
Fold the edges under at the rim and crimp.  Chill the pastry while you
prepare the filling.

*To make filling:  Place oven rack in lowest position; preheat oven to
350°.
Grate zest from lemons into a medium-sized saucepan; set aside.  With a
sharp knife, remove the white pith from the lemons and discard.  Working
over the saucepan to catch the juice, cut the lemon segments from their 
surrounding membranes, letting them drop into the saucepan.  Squeeze any
remaining juice from the membranes into the saucepan.  Stir in sugar 
and salt.  Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring, until sugar
dissolves.  Remove from heat.

In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the eggs and egg whites.  Slowly
whisk the hot lemon-sugar mixture into the eggs.  Pour into the pie 
shell and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the filling is set and light

golden on top.

Let cool on rack.  Before serving, dust with confectioners' sugar.

NOTES : Lemon zest, pulp and juice are combined with eggs and sugar in a
wonderful custard.

boiling water for 5 minutes. Decrease the water in the recipe to 5/8
cup.

  1                cup  quick cooking rolled oats
  1                cup  crisp rice cereal
  1                cup  raisins
     1/2           cup  shelled sunflower seeds

In this recipe, we've combined traditional granola ingredients such as
oats,
sunflower seeds, raisins, honey and spices and created a wholesome,
nutritious bar.  When stored in an airtight container, they will stay soft
and moist for several days.

Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease 13x9-inch pan or spray with nonstick
cooking spray. In large bowl, combine brown sugar, margarine, honey and
egg
white; beat until well blended.  Lightly spoon flour into measuring cup;
level off.  Add flour, cinnamon and baking powder; mix well. Stir in oats,
cereal, raisins and sunflower seeds. Press mixture firmly in bottom of
greased pan.

Bake at 350 degrees F. for 14 to 18 minutes or until edges are light
golden
brown and center appears set. Cool completely. Cut into bars. Store in
tightly covered container.  Makes 36 bars.

NOTES : If you were wondering what to spoon onto your baked potato, I
        think you'll find this the perfect topping.  This familiar
        American sauce is actually a variation on the classic French
        rémoulade.  To accentuate the tartness, add the vinegar from the
        cornichon.s  The amount of chopped onion is up to you.  This will
        keep for a few days in the refrigerator.  Joyce Goldstein

  6             cloves  garlic -- thinly sliced
  12            ounces  medium mushrooms -- thinly sliced
  1                     yellow onion -- thinly sliced
  1                cup  water

                        --diced
     1/2           cup  chervil leaves

Cut 4 zucchini in half lengthwise and carefully scoop out the pulp and
seeds, taking care not to break the skins (leave 1/4" of pulp in shell). 
Chop the pulp and seeds and set aside.  Blanch the zucchini in boiling
water for 5 minutes and then plunge into ice water.  leave the shells in
the water for 10 minutes.  Carefully drain and set aside.

Cut the remaining zucchini into quarters lengthwise and then into 1/4"
slices.  In a medium size pan, combine the chopped zucchini, zucchini
slices, garlic mushrooms, onion, water and salt.  Cook over medium low
heat, uncovered, for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the water has evaporated. 
Remove from the heat and stir in the tarragon.

Stuff the zucchini shells with the vegetable mixture.  Place them in a
shallow baking dish and bake at 350º for 15 minutes.  Finish cooking under
the broiler for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the stuffing begins to brown.

To serve, place 2 zucchini halves on each of 4 plates, sprinkle the diced
tomato over and around, and sprinkle with the chervil leaves.
