  smooth and blended.  Work in flour to a smooth dough.  (You can use a
  mixer for this step, too, but results are superior if you work in the
  flour with your fingertips, a fork or rubber spatula).  Flatten dough
  in foil to form a an 8 X 6 inch rectangle.  Chill overnight.  (You
  can chill it several days before using).  Remove from refrigerator 8
  to 10 minutes before rolling. (Many recipes suggest a 30 minute wait
  before rolling dough, but it's easier to handle when rolled as cold
  as possible). Divide dough for ease in rolling and to insure cold
  dough.
  
  Keep unrolled portion in refrigerator until ready to use.  Roll on
  floured pastry cloth with floured rolling pin or between two sheets
  of waxed paper. The former is easier, in my opinion, and I find
  absolutely no sticking when I use a pastry cloth and covered pin.  I
  first rub cloth and pin well with flour, then shake out excess.  When
  using waxed paper, loosen it on both sides of pastry several times as
  you roll.
  
  Shape as directed in specific recipes and chill before baking.  Brush
  tops (only) of all pastries with egg yolk beaten with cream.  Bake in
  moderate oven (350 degrees) unless otherwise specified.

           Jim Vorheis
    1/3 c  Fresh lime juice
           Sea salt to taste
    1/3 c  Finely chopped radishes
    1/4 c  Finely chopped white onion
      1    Chile peron, black seeds

      1 c  Drained and lightly salted
           -ricotta cheese
      6    Thin 5-inch corn tortillas
      6    Toothpicks
           Safflower oil for frying
 
  Have ready a tray lined with a double thickness of paper toweling.
  
  First make the sauce.  Put the lime juice and salt into a glass bowl,
  mix in the rest of the ingredients, and leave for at least 30 minutes
  to marinate.  This should make about 1 cup.
  
  Spread 1 tablespoon of the ricotta over half of each tortilla. Fold
  over and secure with a toothpick.
  
  Put oil to a depth of 1/4 inch in a large frying pan and heat. When
  hot but not smoking, add a few of the tacos and fry, turning once
  until they are a golden color and quite crisp.  Continue with the
  rest, adding oil if necessary.
  
  Drain the tacos well on paper toweling and remove as soon as they are
  cool enough to handle.  With a toothpick, ease them open and insert
  about 2 tablespoons of the sauce.  Serve immediately; they cannot
  wait.

      Title: Texas Cheese Enchiladas
 Categories: Mexican, Cheese
      Yield: 4 servings
 
     12    Corn Tortillas
      4 tb Cooking Oil
      2 lg Onions, Chopped
      4 c  Grated Cheddar Cheese
      2 tb Shortning (Lard Best)
      2 tb Flour
      2 tb Chile Powder Or Ground Chile
 
  Allow 3 enchiladas per person. Use a Pyrex utility pan (13-1/2" x
  8-3/4") to cook them. Lightly grease the utility pan (for
  authenticity use laed). Preheat the oven to 400F. Chop onions and
  grate cheese. Saute the onions lightly in 2 T. oil. Melt lard in a
  skillet; stir in the flour and make a light roux.  Add ground chiles
  or chile powder, water and salt, and cook until thick. Of commercial
  chile powders, Gebhardt's from San Antonio is best, but not as good
  as ground *chiles pasillas*. Heat the remaining oil in a skillet.
  Using kitchen tongs, dip each tortilla in hot oil until well softened
  (about 15 seconds). Hold tortilla up and allow oil to drip back into
  the skillet. Using the tongs, dip tortillas in chili gravy. Place the
  tortilla in the Pyrex pan,  put a good sized pinch of cheese and
  onions in the middle, and roll the tortilla, placing the flap side
  down. Continue filling and rolling tortillas until the pan is full.
  Pour more chili gravy on top of the enchiladas, sprinkle the top
  generously with more grated cheese, and pop into preheated oven. Cook
  only until the cheese begins to bubble (about 10 minutes). Serve
  immediately.

      4 lg Poblano peppers
    1/4 c  Onion, chopped
    1/2 lb Medium shrimp, lightly
           Cooked, peeled, and chopped
    1/4 c  Cilantro, chopped
    1/4 lb Monterey jack cheese,
           Shredded
      2    8 ozs chicken breasts,
           Halved, deboned, and
           Pounded flat
      2 ts White pepper
           Salt, to taste
     12    6-in long strings
           Oil, for frying

MMMMM--------------------CREAMY SHRIMP SAUCE-------------------------
      3    Shallots, diced
      1 c  White wine
    1/2 c  Fish stock or chicken broth
      1 lb Small shrimp
      2 c  Whipping cream
    3/4 lb Butter
 
  ROAST PEPPERS:  Place poblano peppers under the broiler and char on
  all sides. Put in plastic bag and freeze 10 minutes. Remove from
  freezer, rub off peel, then slit to remove seeds under running water.
  
  Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  In a medium saute pan, saute onion,
  shrimp, and cilantro until the shrimp are almost cooked, about 5
  minutes.  Place in mixture in a bowl, add the cheese and set aside.
  
  TO ASSEMBLE:  Lay the four prepared chicken breasts flat, skin-side
  down. Season with salt and white pepper.  Layer each breast with one
  pepper and 2 to 3 tablespoons shrimp/cheese mixture over pepper. Roll
  each breast tightly to form a cylinder. Tie each cylinder in 3
  places, both ends and in the middle.
  
  In a skillet, heat about 1/4-inch of oil.  Lightly brown chicken
  breasts, one at a time, on all sides. Remove from heat, transfer to a
  oven-proof dish and bake for 10 minutes until golden brown.
  
  Remove from oven.  Cut strings and slice chicken into 1-inch roulades
  (rounds).  Drizzle a few tablespoons of Creamy Shrimp Sauce onto a
  plate and arrange the roulades on top of the sauce. Serve warm. Makes
  4 servings.
  
  TO MAKE CREAMY SHRIMP SAUCE:  In a saucepan over medium-high heat,
  combine shallots and wine.  Cook until reduced by three-fourths.  Add
  stock/broth and shrimp and cook until reduced by half. Add the cream
  and reduce again by half. Whisk in the butter by tablespoons. Cook
  until butter melts and sauce is well-blended. Remove from heat.
