The vegetarian recipes contained in this archive are the work of many
people, but special credit belongs to Mark Satterly of Hamilton, Ontario
for his time and effort in editing and compiling this collection.

Most of the recipes do not use any animal products, although a few will
call for small amounts of egg and/or milk products which are easily
replaced with vegan substitutes.  If you do not use honey, another
sweetener such as sorghum, maple syrup or plain sugar may be used
instead, but Mark recommends increasing the recipe's liquid content
accordingly.
