4th Grade Apple Yum (4 PTS)

none

1/3 cup raisins
3 Tablespoons amaretto; or equal almond flav
3 cups Granny Smith apples; peeled and chopped
1/3 cup sugar
3 Tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
8 sheets Phyllo dough; thawed
2 cups vanilla frozen yogurt

Combine raisins and amaretto (or almond flavoring) in a bowl.  Microwave at
High 1 1/2 minutes (be sure to use the equal flavoring for the amaretto not
the same amount); drain.

Combine raisins, apple, sugar, flour, and cinnamon in bowl.  Toss well and
set aside.  Place 1 phyllo sheet on work surface (keep remaining sheets
covered); lightly coat with Pam.  Add remaining sheets on top of each other
one at a time coating each with Pam in between.  Cover with plastic wrap,
press to seal sheets together, throw away plastic.

Spoon apple mixture along 1 long edge of phyllo leaving 2 inches all the
way
around.  Fold over the short edge to cover 2-3 inches of filling.  Starting
at the long end, roll up like a jelly roll.  Do not try to roll tightly,
the
juices need time to expand.  Place sturdel, seam side down, on a jelly-roll
coated pan sprayed with pam.  Cut small slits in top of the dough.  Bake at
350 for 35 minutes or until golden.  Serve warm with low fat ice cream or
yogurt (included in count).

Yield: 8 slices.  1 slice with 1/4 cup ice cream is a serving.

Apple Cider Doughnuts With Maple Glaze (6.5 PTS)

none

3 tablespoons granulated sugar; for preparing pans
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 large egg; lightly beaten
2/3 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup apple butter
1/3 cup pure maple syrup
1/3 cup apple cider
1/3 cup nonfat plain yogurt
3 tablespoons canola oil  Maple glaze:
1 1/4 cups confectioner's sugar
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/4 cup pure maple syrup; (1/4 to 1/3)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Coat the molds of a mini-Bundt pan with
nonstick cooking spray or oil. Sprinkle with white sugar, shaking out the
excess.

In a mixing bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt,
and cinnamon; set aside. In another bowl, whisk together egg, brown sugar,
apple butter, maple syrup, cider, yogurt and oil. Add the dry ingredients
and stir just until moistened. Divide half the batter among the prepared
molds, spooning about 2 generous tablespoonfuls of batter into each mold.

Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the tops spring back when touched
lightly. Loosen the edges and turn the cakes out onto a wire rack to cool.
Clean the mini-Bundt pan, then recoat it with cooking spray or oil and
sugar. Repeat with the remaining batter. To make maple glaze:

In a bowl, combine confectioners' sugar and vanilla. Gradually whisk in
enough maple syrup to make a coating consistency. Dip the fluted side of
the
"doughnuts" in the glaze to coat. Then set them glazed side up on a wire
rack over waxed paper for a few minutes until the glaze has set.

1/2 cup wheat bran
  hodgeson Mill unprocessed
3/4 cup pumpkin, canned
3  egg whites

*I spray the muffin papers with pam or use a non-stick muffin pan but I
still spray it with pam.  They are so low fat that they stick to the paper
and the pan.
**They should be kept refrigerated or frozen. (no preservatives)
*** Freezes well
NOTES: These are great muffins that are 2 points for 2 ( or 4 muffins
for 3 points:) because they are so high in fiber.

NOTES : JENN'S LOWER FAT NOTES: The origional called for Oleo.  I found out
that Oleo is the name of one of the earliest brands of margarine.  The
origional called for reg cream of mushroon and cream of chicken soup,
called for reg sharp cheese, and reg cubed beef and pork.  I changed all
these to lower fat versions.

JENN'S NOTES: I'd probably add some broccoli or cauliflower or other
veggies to this :)

Baked Tomatoes Stuffed With Orzo  (5 Points)

none

5 1/3 oz orzo
4 lg tomatoes; firm, ripe
  sugar
2/3 tsp salt
  black pepper
1/3 tsp dried oregano; rubbed
1/3 c mozzarella cheese, part skim milk; cubed
2 2/3 tbsp reduced-calorie margarine
2/3 med onion; finely chopped
1 1/3 pt lowfat chicken broth
2 2/3 tbsp parmesan cheese; freshly grated

Remove the center pulp and seeds from the tomatoes, hollowing them out
well. Lightly sprinkle into each tomato a little sugar, salt, pepper and
oregano; place four cubes of mozzarella in each tomato.

Preheat oven to 400-degrees.

Melt the butter in a saucepan and saute the onion in it until soft; stir
in the orzo, stirring well so each grain of pasta is coated. Pour in 2
cups of the chicken broth, stir well, and simmer until it is absorbed,
adding more broth gradually until the orzo is about three quarters cooked;
firmer than al dente (I cooked mine longer--don't like pasta that firm).
Taste it as you go and cook until it's as firm as you like. Blend in the
Parmesan, stirring it in well.

Spoon the orzo mixture into the hollowed tomatoes, filling them. Place the
filled tomatoes in a casserole or baking dish with 1/2 cup of hot broth in
the bottom of the dish.

Bake, covered, for 15 minutes; remove the cover and cook an additional 10
minutes.

BAKLAVA (1 Point)

none

1/2 lb pistachio nuts  ground
3 tb Sugar
3/4 ts Ground cinnamon
1 1/2 tb Rose water
1/2 lb Filo dough
1/2 c reduced-calorie margarine  melted
  rose water
  Whole cloves; optional

This rich-tasting baklava contains half the amount of sugar and a fraction
of the fat you would normally use, thanks to reduced fats, sugar, and
nuts. The   results will fool anyone.

1. Combine pistacho nuts, sugar, cinnamon and rose water in small bowl.
Using half of filo sheets (cover remaining with plastic wrap to prevent
from drying out), place 3 sheets in bottom of lightly greased 13x9" baking
sheet. Brush with some of margarine. Sprinkle evenly with nut mixture.
Place remaining sheets over nut filling, brushing after every third sheet
and top sheet.
2. Cut baklava at 1-1/2" intervals diagonally to form pattern of about 5
diamond shapes. Bake at 400'F. 25 minutes or until golden. Place on wire
rack to cool. Drizzle Rose Water Syrup evenly over top and allow to soak
several hours.

Stud each diamond-shape with whole clove.

Banana Bran Bread/Muffins (3 PTS)

none

1 1/2 cups flour
1/2 cup sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1  egg; large
1 1/2 cups mashed bananas; 2 to 3
1 1/2 cups 100% Bran(r) cereal; not flakes, but
  twigs
1/4 cup water
2 tablespoons oil
1 teaspoon vanilla

Heat oven to 350°F. Coat a 9x5x3" pan with no-stick cooking spray.

Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda & salt in large bowl.

In a separate medium size bowl, beat egg, then stir in bananas, cereal,
water, oil & vanilla.

Add this mixture to the flour mixture, stir until just moistened (batter
will be lumpy).

Pour into pan & bake 50-60 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean.

Cool 10 minutes, then remove from pan & cool completely on a rack. (For
easier slicing, wrap & store overnight).

NOTES : This is a my favorite  low-point banana bread with lots of fiber.
But be forewarned, my kids (who only like their bread
white) are not wild about it (but that leaves more for hubby and me).

I also make this into a dozen banana bran muffins which I find easier for
portion control.
Use a muffin tin that has been sprayed with Pam and bake for about 15
minutes at 375°F. Use a toothpick to test for doneness.
I try to keep a batch of these in my freezer door for a quick breakfast on
the run.  I put each muffin in a cheap sandwich bag and
then place them all in a gallon-size freezer ziploc.

NOTES : It's important to make sure eggs are safe, which means bringing
them
to a temperature of at least 160º.  Be sure to do this slowly over heat no
higher than medium so you don't curdle the yolks.  Using your heaviest
saucepan will control and disperse the heat much better than a thinner pan.
The dry milk gives this ice cream a smooth consistency and adds calcium,
too.

Bean Totasdas With Corn Salsa (5 PTS)

none

1 4 x 6 inch (15 cm) corn tortillas
15 1/2 oz pinto or black beans; rinsed and drained
1 cup salsa (fresh)

8 oz low sodium canned corn; drained
3/4 cup reduced-fat sharp cheddar cheese; shredded
1 cup romaine lettuce; shredded
1/2  avocado; diced
1/2 cup fat-free sour cream
2  scallions; thinly sliced
2 tablespoons cilantro; chopped

1. Preheat oven to 450°F (230°C).

2. Arrange tortillas in a single layer on a baking sheet and bake until
crisp and light brown around edges, 5 to 7 minutes.

3. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, mix beans and 1/2 cup salsa. Cook,
stirring as needed and mashing beans, until heated through, about 5
minutes.

4. In a small bowl, mix remaining 1/2 cup of salsa and corn.

5. Place tortillas on plates. Spread each with bean mixture, then top with

from the pit. Place that half flat-side down on a cutting board and peel
off
the skin. Cut the avocado into bite-size cubes.

Original recipe called for 1 lb. steak, which would have brought it under
30% CFF, but we like more meat in it. Russell Fletcher
webauthor@bigfoot.com

Betsy's Notes: Made 2/14/00. Had 1 1/2 lbs of extra lean stew beef in cubes
and used it just as it was (original recipe called for 1 lb of t-bone
steak,
and then sliced it thin). To make up for the extra beef I increased the
broth to use the whole can (was 1 cup), and the flour (was 1/3 cup). And,
because the extra beef gave me additional servings, I increased the noodle
amount to give me the right nutritional analysis.

1 envelope dry yeast
1 teaspoon sugar
1/4 cup warm water; (105 - 115 F)
1/2 ounce unsweetened chocolate
1 tablespoon margarine
1 1/4 cups water
1/4 cup dark molasses
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
1 tablespoon salt
1/2 cup All-Bran(r) Cereal
2 cups all-purpose flour; (2 to 2 3/4)
1 1/2 cups rye flour

Sprinkle yeast and sugar over 1/4 cup water; stir to dissolve. Let stand

cup more all-purpose flour if necessary to form workable dough. Add dough
to
prepared bowl, turning to coat entire surface. Cover and let rise in warm
draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 2 hours.

Grease two 3 x 2 x 7-inch loaf pans. Punch dough down. Turn out onto
lightly
floured surface and let rest 3 minutes. Knead 3 minutes. Divide dough in
half. Roll each into 7 x 8-inch rectangle. Starting with long side, roll
dough up into cylinder. Tuck ends under and pinch seam to seal. Place seam
side down in prepared pans. Cover and let rise in warm draft-free area
until
doubled, about 1-1/2 hours.

Preheat oven to 375°F.  Bake until loaves sound hollow when tapped on
bottom,
about 45 minutes. Remove bread from pans. Let cool completely on rack
before
serving.

Blossoming Onion (2 PTS)

none

2 large red onions; about. 1 1/2 lbs
1/2 cup bread crumbs; or Panko
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon paprika
2 large egg whites

Preheat the oven to 375* F.  Lightly spray a baking sheet with olive oil
spray.

Peel the skin from the onions and trim the bottoms so that the onions sit
flat. Starting at the center of the top of each onion and working around
it, cut 20 to 30 slits, cutting only three-quarters into the onion for a
"flower" effect. Transfer to the baking sheet.

In a small bowl, combine the bread crumbs, garlic powder and paprika. Set
aside. In another bowl, whisk the egg whites lightly with a fork. Pour the

whites over the onion to cover thoroughly and then sprinkle evenly with
the seasoned crumbs. Spray lightly with olive oil spray and bake for 40 to

50 minutes, until the onions are lightly browned. Serve Immediately.

Breakfast Burritos (3 PTS)

none

1 cup Egg Beaters(r) 99% egg substitute; equiv to 8 eggs
4  eggs
2 tablespoons water
  salt and pepper; to taste
6 3/8 ounces Healthy Choice Lowfat Breakfast Sau; 8 patties- 1 package
1/2  onion; chopped
1/2  green pepper; chopped
10  98% Fatfree Flour Tortillas; 1 bag/Mission brand
1/2 cup shredded lowfat cheese; *Sargento light
1 Tablespoon butter; or margarine
  cooking spray

Sauté onion and pepper in non-stick pan which has been sprayed
with desired flavor of non-stick spray. Add cut up Healthy Choice
sausage and stir into vegetable mixture. (No need to cook sausage;
it's fully pre-cooked.)

Transfer to a bowl or bag and refrigerate.

Lightly beat eggs and egg substitute with the water. Melt butter or
margarine in the skillet that was used to sauté the onions and peppers
(or use non-stick spray). When melted, stir in egg mixture.

Cook eggs until almost done, keeping in fairly large curds. Salt and
pepper to taste.

Combine eggs and cooled sausage mixture.

Warm tortillas in the microwave. Place about 1/4 cup of the egg mixture
in the center of a tortilla.

Top with 1 scant tablespoon of shredded cheddar cheese.

Roll tortilla and wrap in waxed paper, tape to seal (label if making more
than one kind).

Place waxed paper wrapped tortillas in a zip-lock freezer bag in
the freezer.

To heat from freezer:

Cook a single wrapped burrito in the microwave for about 2 minutes
on 50% power (or' defrost') (would take longer if you were doing
multiples). Then microwave for about 1/2 minute more on full power
or until hot. Just peel the paper down as you eat so that all the
filling stays in.

NOTES : I got the original recipe for these from Libby. I've been
experimenting with lowering the fat and calorie content without
"ruining" the flavor and texture. This is my final "successful" experiment!
I chose to use a small amount of real butter and real eggs, but these
could easily by made with all egg substitute and cooking
spray. This would change the nutritional analysis to:

Caramelized Onions (3 PTS)

none

3 pounds sweet onions
1/4 cup butter
10 ounces vegetable broth

Place the onions, butter and broth in a crock pot and cook on low 12-24
hours until the onions are deep golden brown and very soft. Different crock
pots will take different amounts of time. It is almost impossible to
overcook this, so go for the deepest brown. Use the onions and liquid to
flavor soup, stock, and stews. they make a wonderful addition to risotto, a
perfect pasta sauce, and the world's best pizza topping (drain off the
liquid first).

Caribbean Jerk Chicken (6 PTS)

none

1 pound chicken breasts without skin
1 teaspoon whole cloves
1 teaspoon peppercorns
1/2 cup cider vinegar
1/2 cup soy sauce, low sodium
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 cup red wine
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 large Spanish onions; chopped
1/4 cup scallions; chopped   (white and gree
1 tablespoon jalapeno pepper; chopped
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon thyme
1/4 teaspoon white pepper
1/4 cup lime juice

Prepare marinade:

Crush whole cloves and peppercorns in a spice grinder or coffee grinder.
(Blender might work, too). Combine with all other ingredients, except
chicken in a blender or food processor. Blend until the marinade is thick
and smooth, with no chunks in it.

Place the chicken in a non-metal container. A glass bowl is good; so are
ziplock bags. Pour the marinade over the chicken. (Instead of individual
breasts, I used skinless chicken tenders, which I buy frozen by the large
bagful at a warehouse store). Marinate, refrigerated, for 8 hours or
overnight.

Remove the chicken from the marinade. Discard the marinade. Cook the

chicken on a grill 6 minutes on each side, or until there is no trace of
pink inside. Or, cook in a lightly-oiled cast iron pan over high heat. (You
could broil it in the oven, too.)

Slice into strips before serving, if you wish.

Caribbean Spice Chicken (5 PTS)

none

1/2 cup Lemon Juice
1/4 cup chili sauce
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon dried basil
1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley
2 pounds Boneless Skinless Chicken Breast
  Aluminum Foil

Combine liquid ingredients, basil and parsley in shallow baking dish to
create marinade. Mix well. If using Fresh Chicken, rinse well with cold
water and pat dry with paper towels. If using frozen poultry, rinse well
with water to remove ice glaze and pat dry with paper towels. Place chicken
in marinade. Cover dish with foil. Marinate in refrigerator for 2 hours.
Drain chicken and discard marinade. Grill or broil chicken as desired until
fully cooked. Refrigerate leftover chicken in fresh sheet of foil.

Grill chicken until tender and the juices run clear. Try grilling chicken
using the indirect method: make a drip pan from Heavy Duty aluminum foil;
surround foil drip pan with coals and place chicken on rack directly above
the drip pan; chicken will cook more slowly, but will be less likely to
burn or become charred. To keep chicken from sticking, spray grill with
non-stick cooking spray, or rub with vegetable oil prior to grilling.

Carolina Cocktail Sauce (1 PT)

none

1 cup chili sauce (Heinz brand)
1/4 cup prepared horseradish; well drained (you
  might want to start out
  adding just a touch of this - it ca
  rather hot and it's easier to add
  more then to take any away - taste
  go along and stop adding when it
  suites your palate.)
1/4 cup granulated sugar
2 tablespoons distilled vinegar
2 teaspoons minced sweet onion
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
2 teaspoons celery seed
1 teaspoon celery salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon hot pepper sauce

In a medium, glass or stainless steel bowl whisk together all the
ingredients until completely combined and the sugar dissolves. Cover and
refrigerate for at least one day to give the flavors time to blend. (Two
days is even better.)

Makes 8 servings

Good cocktail sauce is a MUST for shrimp - it almost MAKES the meal and
boiled shrimp without a good sauce is like a dance with no music! This is
one of my favorite sauces - I keep everything on hand to make this so that
I'm not caught 'dancing with no music!' *lol*

NOTES : Rolled dumplings are a traditional favorite of African Americans.
This round drop version is easy to prepare and has a slightly
different texture, but with the addition of pepper, they keep their
spunk!

To keep Bisquick baking mix fresh longer, refrigerate after opening.

Pureeing ingredients in a blender may seem odd, but you'll be pleased with
the result. Instead of folding chunks of cooked
chicken into cooked spaghetti, arrange the sliced chicken atop the
casserole, add a little more sauce, and top it with breadcrumbs
and cheese. Then pop the dish into the oven long enough to brown the top.

NOTES : Here is a wonderful pie - one of my all-time favorite recipes!!
If its hot where you are - try it!! *Hint: I have trouble
with clumping in my pies. I have solved that problem by using
lukewarm water and dissolving the dry milk powder in the water. Then I
let it sit a few minutes while I measure out other ingredients to get them
ready to put in the recipe. Then I mix the wet mixture in with the pudding.
It is so cooling and refreshing and creamy and CHOCOLATEY
"I freeze this pie (individual slices). When I want it, I set it out about
15-30
minutes ahead of time. Let it thaw enough to eat
it. WOWSERS!!! Is it good!!! I reminds me of mint chocolate-chip ice
cream and York Peppermint Patties. (I didn't tell my daughter
that this pie is "healthy" - I just told her that its a mint chocolate chip
pie
- she loves it). "

Chocolate-Peppermint Angel Pie (5 PTS)

none

  **MERINGUE CRUST**
3 large egg whites; at room temperature
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/8 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup sugar (preferably super fine)
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
  **Chocolate Mousse Filling**
1 cup skim milk
1 large egg
1/3 cup light corn syrup
2 teaspoons light corn syrup; combine two corn syr
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 ounces semisweet chocolate; finely chopped
2 ounces Neufchatel cheese; softened
2 teaspoons unflavored gelatin
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon peppermint extract
1/2 cup sugar
2 large egg whites; room temperature
  **Garnish**
1 ounce semisweet chocolate

TO MAKE CRUST: Preheat oven to 275 degrees F.  Lightly oil a 9-inch pie
plate and set aside.

In a large mixing bowl, combine egg whites, cream of tartar and salt.
Beat with an electric mixer until soft peaks form.  Add 1/4 cup sugar
and beat for 30 seconds.  Gradually beat in the remaining 1/2 cup sugar.
Add vanilla and beat for 7 to 10 minutes longer, stopping occasionally to
scrape down the sides of the bowl, until all the sugar is dissolved and
the meringue is stiff and shiny.

Spread the meringue over the bottom and sides of the prepared pie
plate.  Using the back of a spoon, spread some meringue up to the rim,
forming
a decorative edge.  Alternatively, using a piping bag fitted with a start
tip, pipe the meringue into the pie plate.  Bake for about 1 hour and
15 minutes, or until firm and crisp.  Cool on a wire rack.  (The meringue
crust can be prepared ahead and stored, covered, in an airtight
container for up to 1 week.)

TO MAKE FILLING:  In a medium-sized mixing bowl, whisk together 1/4 cup
milk, 1 whole egg, 1/3 cup corn syrup and cocoa until smooth.  In a
heavy 2 quart saucepan, heat the remaining 3/4 cup milk until bubbles
appear
at the edge; remove from heat.  Whisk a little hot milk into the cocoa
mixture.  Then whisk the cocoa mixture into the remaining milk in the
saucepan.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden
spoon, for 3 to 5 minutes, or until slightly thickened.  Remove from heat
and
whisk in chocolate and cream cheese until smooth.  Set aside.

In a small saucepan, sprinkle gelatin over 1/4 cup water.  let soften
for about 3 minutes.  heat over low heat for 1 to 3 minutes, or until the
gelatin is dissolved.  whisk into the chocolate mixture along with
vanilla and peppermint.  Set aside.

In a small saucepan, combine 1/4 cup water, 1/2 cup sugar and 2 tsp.
corn syrup.  Bring to a boil and cook, without stirring, over medium-high
heat for about 5 minutes, or until the syrup registers 230 degrees F on a
candy thermometer and is at thread stage (when a bit of syrup dipped in
cold
water forms a fine thread).  At this point, in a medium-sized mixing
bowl, begin beating egg whites with an electric mixer at medium low speed.
Beat until soft peaks form.  Add the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and beat
at medium high speed until egg whites are stiff but not dry.

When the sugar syrup registers 239 degrees F and is at soft-ball stage
(when a bit of syrup dipped in cold water forms a soft, pliable ball),
gradually pour it over the beaten egg whites, beating constantly at
medium-high speed.  Beat at medium speed for about 5 minutes longer, or
until the egg whites are stiff, satiny and cool.

Whisk about 1 cup of this meringue into the chocolate mixture.  fold in
the remaining meringue.  turn into the prepared meringue crust,
spreading to the edges.  Smooth top.  Cover loosely with plastic and
refrigerate
until the filling is set, for at least 3 hours or for up to 8 hours.

TO GARNISH PIE: If desired, warm chocolate in a microwave oven at
medium low (30 percent) power for 1 to 2 minutes, or just until slightly
softened but not melted.  Alternatively, warm it in a 250 degree F oven for
3 to
5 minutes  using a vegetable peeler, shave off curls onto a sheet of wax
paper.  Arrange the curls decoratively over the top of the pie.

Corn Chowder (6 PTS)

none

1 tablespoon bacon grease
1 medium onion; peeled and chopped
2  celery ribs; strings removed and
  chopped
3/4  green pepper; cored and chopped
3/4  red pepper; cored and chopped
1/3 cup flour
1 quart fat-free chicken broth
2 3/4 cups frozen super-sweet corn kernels
3 cups diced potatoes
1/2  bay leaf
1 can evaporated skim milk; (1 ounce) (1 to 12)
1/2 cup nonfat sour cream
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon white pepper
1/2 teaspoon Tabasco hot sauce
1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce

Add the bacon grease (use butter if you don't have or want to use bacon
grease) to a 5-quart saucepan and place over medium heat. When the grease
is hot, add the onions, celery, peppers, and cook, stirring occasionally,
for 7 to 8 minutes, or until soft. Add the flour and cook for 4 minutes,
stirring. Using a wire whisk, whisk in the chicken broth and whip out any
lumps until smooth. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes. While
the soup is simmering, puree half the corn in a food processor. Add the
pureed corn, remaining corn kernels, potatoes, and bay leaf to the saucepan
and simmer until the potatoes are tender, stirring occasionally, about 15
minutes. Whisk in the evaporated skim milk, sour cream, and seasonings.
Remove the bay leaf. Cook until hot; do not boil. Serve immediately dusted
with the chopped parsley.

I enjoy thick and hearty soups, in fact that is the one thing I _really_
miss during the summer because here in West Texas it's just TOO hot to have
a bowl of soup between May and October! *lol* Sometimes, early in May, if
it rains and is chilly I will scurry and put a pot of some sort of soup on
- knowing that it will most likely be the last time until the next cold
spell hits - months away... This is one of the 'standards' I use for such
an occasion... My three favorites are Potato Soup, Split Pea Soup and this
bone warming Corn Chowder. *sigh* Come on 70's, I want soup again!

Country Chicken Pate (2 PTS)

none

1 teaspoon butter or stick margarine
1/2 cup finely chopped onion
2 cloves garlic; chopped
4 ounces chicken livers
2 tablespoons port or other sweet red wine
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 dash ground cinnamon
1 dash ground allspice
1 tablespoon low-fat sour cream
1 pound boned skinned chicken breast
  cut into 1/2-inch pieces
8 ounces fat-free cream cheese; block
  cubed and softened
  cooking spray

We kept the creamy texture of this lightened classic by using low-fat
sour cream and fat-free cream cheese instead of butter and heavy cream.
Serve this rich appetizer with a French bread baguette, coarse-grained
mustard, and gherkins.

1.  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

2.  Melt butter in a small nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Add
onion and garlic, and saute 4 minutes.  Add chicken livers; cook 2
minutes or until livers lose their pink color.  Add port, and cook 3
minutes or until most of liquid evaporates.  Cool.

3.  Place chicken liver mixture, salt, and next 5 ingredients (salt
through allspice) in a food processor or blender;  process until
smooth, scraping sides of bowl occasionally.  Add the sour cream,
chicken breast, and cream cheese;  process until smooth, scraping sides
of bowl occasionally.  Spread chicken mixture into an 8 x 4-inch pan
coated with cooking spray.  Bake at 325 degrees for 1 hour or until a
thermometer registers 170 degrees.  Cool;  cover and chill 8 hours.
Serve at room temperature.

NOTES : Once the soup is processed, the addition of extra yogurt adds a
creamy texture.  The diced cucumber and radishes add a crunchy texture.  If
hothouse cucumbers are not available, substitute the firm garden variety
and double the amount called for.  Peel cucumbers and halve lengthwise,
then seed.

Crustless Chicken And Broccoli Quiche (3 PTS Ea Slice)

none

2 cups broccoli flowerets; coarsely chopped
2 tablespoons dry bread crumbs
3 tablespoons flour, all-purpose
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1 cup 1% milk
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
4 ounces egg substitute, frozen
1 1/2 cups roasted chicken; chopped
1/2 cup cheddar cheese, lowfat; shredded & divided
1/4 teaspoon paprika

Preheat oven to 350.  Cook broccoli in boiling water until crisp but
tender.
Drain.  Coat a 9 inch pie plate with cooking spray; sprinkle with
breadcrumbs.

Combine flour, basil, salt and pepper in a large bowl; add milk and
mustard;
stir with a whisk.  Stir in egg substitute.  Add chicken and 1/4 cup
cheese;
stir well.  Pour mix in pie plate.  sprinkle with rest of cheese and

You can lower the fat and possibly the count? by using 99% free egg
beaters, but I prefer the other, which has more fat.

broth full boil, and add the diced meat. Continue with recipe.) Add the
corn, celery, parsley, and cooked noodles to the broth. Return the soup to

Dolmades 2  (4 Per Serving At 4 Points Including Sauce!)

none

80  grape leaves
1 Lb Ground Round
1 1/3 Cups White Rice; Uncooked Conven
1 Bunch Dill
3 Small Onion
2 Medium egg whites
1 Medium Egg
1 Tablespoon Olive Oil
  salt and pepper; to taste
4  Lemons; 1/2 For Sauce
1  Leek
1 Bunch Parsely
6 Cloves garlic
10  green onion, whole; Chopped
1 Cup Hot Water; May Need Adjusting

Heat the1 table of  oil in a skillet.  Add the onions and leek  and saute
for about 5 minutest.  Add the garlic and cook for a few minutes, then add
the rice, dill, parsley1/2 , lemon juice, salt,  pepper.  Stir well, then
add the hotwater.  Cover and simmer about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat
and cool.

Next  carefully remove the grapevine leaves from the jar, leaving the
brine in the jar.  Wash grapevine leaves thoroughly and drain
.  (If using fresh
grapevine leaves use the same procedure, parboiling leaves for 5 minutes
when not tender, then drain.)
Line an enameled pan with a few heavy
grapevine leaves and set aside.  To stuff a grapevine leaf, put it on your
working surface rough side up and stem end near you, and place a
teaspoonful of the rice mixture near the stem end.  Using both hands, fold
the part of the leaf near you up and over the filling.  Then fold the
right side of the leaf over the filling, then the left side, and roll
tightly and back away from you and toward the pointed end of leaf.  Place
the  seam side down, in the prepared pan.  Continue stuffing
grapevine leaves until the mixture has been used.  (If any grapevine
leaves remain, replace in the reserved brine for future use.)  Place an
inverted plate on the dolmades, then add enough water to cover the
dolmades   Bring to a boil, then cover the pan,
lower the heat, and simmer as slowly as possible for 1-1/4 hours, then
taste one to see if the rice is tender, and continue cooking slowly if
necessary.  Cool, then chill.  Serve cold, as an appetizer or as an
entree.

Egg lemon sauce
Take  2 egg whites , beat till foamy. Then add 1yolk , juice from 1-2
squeezed lemons. Take 1/2 cup of left over water from cooking and add, MUST
BE COOLED
.Cook on low to medium heat untill just thick. pour over domades, carefuly
not to open up!

freeze individually in freezer on cookie sheet or foil the n when flash
frozen stick in baggies and remove when needed!

NOTES : these taste just as yummy without sauce and with a bit of olive oil
and lemon sprinkled or sprayed with mister on top!point s will be the same.
if there is any left over "filling" it can be put into a pie crust and used
as a pot pie type filling! my self though i would add soem water and tomato
paste and cook the rice for at least 20 minutes before putting in pie
crust!

You can also "flash freeze" these on a cookie pan in freezer and when just
about frozen pop in freezer bags!

ok i adjusted it a bit combineing the best of both ...not very traditional
but for thos e watching points it ROCKS!

Double-Stuffed Potatoes Or Mashed (5 Lbs 4-5 PTS)

none

5 pounds Idaho potatoes; 10 medium
4 tablespoons butter
3/4 cup skim milk; to 1/2 c warmed
4 tablespoons parmesan cheese; grated
1/2 cup nonfat cottage cheese; I use high calcium
  kind
1/2 cup nonfat sour cream
  salt and white pepper; to taste

1a).  For Mashed Potatoes:
Peel potatoes and cut into chunks (about 2 inches square). Boil in salted
water for about 20 minutes -- until tender. Drain potatoes
and place back in pot.  Proceed as below:

1b). For Baked Double-stuffed :
Wash potatoes well and prick with a fork. Bake for about 1 hour at 425
degrees (until done).
Cut potatoes in half lengthwise and scoop out insides. Put potato pulp into
a
large bowl and proceed per below directions:

2). Mash potatoes with butter, then stir in milk and cheeses. (If serving
"fussy
eaters", you may want to puree cottage cheese before adding -- I don't
usually do this, but it made for a smoother texture the one time that I
tried it)
Stir in sour cream and desired seasonings. (I often use seasoned salt and a
pinch  of cajun seasoning.)

3a). Serve immediately as mashed potatoes or...

3b). Place in a 8" square casserole dish that has been sprayed with cooking
oil spray. Sprinkle with paprika and bake uncovered at 350 degrees for
about 30  minutes for potato casserole or...

3c). Fill each potato skin, place on baking sheet, sprinkle with Paprika
and
bake for approximately 20-30 mins at 350 to 425 degrees (depending on
what else you have cooking in the oven).

I don't really care for the flavor or texture of potatoes that have been
frozen and thawed, but I'm picky...  so, I have yet to try freezing these;
but I imagine that the casserole and the skins would both freeze well.
(I might consider leaving out the sour cream if freezing.)

I'm not sure how long they would take to reheat from the frozen state.  I
would try 350 degrees and check on the double-stuffs after 35 mins and
the casserole after 45 mins.

These double-stuffed potatoes keep well for at least a week in the fridge
(as long as you use fresh milk).  I reheat in a 350 degree toaster oven
for about 12 minutes.

Fall Vegetable Risotto

none

2 pounds butternut squash
3 cups nonfat low-salt chicken broth
  salt and pepper
3 medium leeks; dice  white part and one
1 1/2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 1/2 cups arborio rice
3  garlic cloves; minced
2 tablespoons fresh flatleaf parsley; chopped
1 teaspoon fresh thyme; chopped
1/2 teaspoon fresh rosemary; chopped
1/2 teaspoon fresh sage; chopped
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg; freshly grated
1 teaspoon orange zest; grated
1/2  orange; juiced  options:
3 tablespoons pecans; toasted and chopped
1/2 cup freshly grated parmigiano-reggiano

Cut squash in half lengthwise, then scoop out and discard seeds. Peel and
cut into 1/2- inch chunks.

In a medium-size saucepan over high heat, bring broth and 3 cups water to a
simmer. Add squash and simmer until almost tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove
squash and season with salt and pepper, and set aside. Reserve broth
separately.

stock. Stir often to keep rice from sticking, adding more stock a ladleful
at a time to keep grains moist. After 10 minutes of adding broth and
stirring, add leeks, garlic. and next 7 ingredients (through juice) and
continue to stir. Continue to add broth until the rice is render with no
chalky centers (but still firm), 18 to 22 minutes. If you run out of broth,
add hot water. When rice is just tender, add an additional ladle of broth
or
water and reserved squash. Remove pan from heat, cover, and let sit 5
minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

To serve, place the risotto in a bowl and garnish with pecans and cheese.

Favorite Vegetable Soup  Beef Variation (0 PTS)

none

1 cup diced onion; 1/2 bag frozen is
  OK
1 46 oz can V-8(r) vegetable juice; or tomato juice
3 teaspoons instant beef broth granules or
3 packets instant beef broth & seasoning mix
6 teaspoons beef bouillon concentrate; Bovril
3 cups water
8 cloves minced garlic; (equal to 4 tsp. in
  jar)
10 cups assorted sliced veggies; *see Note
4 teaspoons fresh parsley; chopped (or 1 tsp
  dried)
1 teaspoon dried basil leaves; ( I prefer 1Tb
  fresh)
1/2 teaspoon pepper; (I use a bit less
  of restaurant grind)

1). Spray large (5+ Quart), non-stick saucepan lightly with Pam. Saute
onions
over medium heat until almost translucent.  Add garlic and dry beef mix (if
using).  Continue cooking until onion is translucent. (I like my onions
lightly
browned).

2). Stir in remaining ingredients except for V-8, water and Bovril.  Cover
and cook
over low heat for about 10 minutes.

3). Add 3 cups of water, V-8 juice and liquid Bovril (if using), and bring
to a
boil.  Reduce heat, cover and simmer about 20 minutes (until vegetables are
soft).

4). Use a slotted spoon to remove about 2 cups of vegetables from pan; set
aside.

5). Allow soup to cool to room temperature.  Puree remaining soup in a
blender
in small batches. (I use my Braun  hand blender right in the pot)

6). Return pureed mixture and reserved vegetables to saucepan and heat.

This soup is especially good with 7 - 8 fat-free cracked pepper crackers
(which count as one bread serving/point).

I like to microwave 1 1/2 cups of this soup for about 2 minutes (150 °F)
and
eat with the crackers about 30 minutes before lunch.

Nutrition estimated by MasterCook 5 (with assorted sliced veggies linked
to frozen California-blend):

79 cals, trace fat (4% CFF), 5g fiber

I have also made WW veggie soup in my crockpot.  I just brown the onions
first and then throw everything into the crockpot on low for however many
hours I'll be gone(usually all day).  You can't really mess this up -- just
make
sure that the veggies are as soft as you like them. I usually saute
large quantities of onions and mushrooms and keep (freezer-weight)
ziplocks of them in the freezer for making soups and adding bulk to my
suppers.

prepare.
Make it by topping a layer of fresh fruit with batter and baking; the
resulting texture is between that of a puding and a cake.

Fish Fillets Oscar (3.5 PTS)

none

4 fillets fresh or frozen sole or flounder (3; 1/4-1/2" thick
2 tablespoons mayonnaise or salad dressing
2 tablespoons plain yogurt
1/2 teaspoon fresh tarragon; snipped
1 pound fresh asparagus
4  lemon; thinly sliced
2  green onions; thinly sliced
4 sprigs fresh tarragon
  tarragon sprigs (optional)

Thaw fish, if frozen.

For sauce, combine mayonnaise or salad dressing, yogurt, and 1/2
teaspoon tarragon. Cover and chill until serving time. Break off and
discard woody bases from asparagus. Cut asparagus into 4-inch pieces.

Tear off four 24x18-inch pieces of foil. Fold each in half crosswise
to make 12x18-inch rectangles. Place a fish fillet on each foil square,
tucking thin ends under. Top each fillet with a lemon slice. Divide green
onions and asparagus evenly among fillets. Top each with a tarragon sprig.
Bring up two opposite edges of foil and seal with double fold. Then
fold remaining hands to completely enclose, leaving space for steam to
build.

Grill packets on an uncovered grill directly over medium coals about 15
minutes or just until fish begins to flake easily when tested with a fork.
Serve with sauce. Garnish with additional tarragon sprigs, if desired.

To grill by indirect heat: Arrange preheated coals around a drip pan
in a covered grill. Test for medium heat above pan. Place packets on grill
over drip pan. Cover and grill about 20 minutes or just until fish begins
to flake easily when tested with a fork.

Fresh Prickly Pear Ice (4.5 PTS)

none

3 1/2 pounds fresh prickly pears; (abt 18 med)
1 cup water
1 cup sugar
3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice

Cut a 1/2-inch slice off both ends of the prickly pears, then make a
1/2-inch deep incision down one side, end to end. Carefully (there are
spines) peel off the rind, starting from your incision. If the prickly pear
is ripe, the rind will easily peel away. Roughly chop the peeled fruit.

Place the fruit in a blender or food processor. Add water, sugar and lime
juice and blend for several minutes, or until the sugar is dissolved.
Strain
through a medium-mesh sieve. Taste for sweetness, adding more sugar or lime
juice if necessary. Chill thoroughly.

Pour chilled mixture into canister of ice cream freezer and freeze
according
to manufacturer's directions. When the ice comes out of the machine, it may
be rather soft; for a firmer texture, let it ``ripen'' in your freezer for
a
couple of hours before serving.

Fudge Brownies, Hot (4.5 PTS)

none

1 cup flour
3/4 cup sugar
2 teaspoons baking soda
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa
1/2 teaspoon salt; optional
1/2 cup skim milk
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce
  TOPPING
3/4 cup brown sugar, packed
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa
1 1/4 cups hot water; from 1 to 1 3/4c

Preheat oven to 350F. Spray 8x8 baking pan with nonstick spray.

In a large bowl mix flour, sugar, baking soda, salt and cocoa. Sift if
needed. Stir in milk, applesauce and vanilla. Spread in prepared pan. Mix
remaining ingredients in a medium size bowl stirring to blend. Pour over
batter and DO NOT stir. Bake for 40 minutes and serve warm scooping sauce
from the bottom.

As it bakes a fudgy sauce forms on the bottom. The thickness of this sauce
depends on the amount of water used. 1 cup of water makes a pudding like
consistency that gets thinner the more water you add. I used 1 1/4 c water
for a medium thick sauce. Serve with a fat free frozen yogurt spooning
sauce
over - no one will ever know the fat is missing! Extremely addicting and
yummy!

well. But
steer clear of green peppers - the flavor is too strong.

NOTES : At i. Cugini restaurant in Santa Monica, the culinary accent
is Italian, as clearly expressed by this salad. It flaunts the colors
of Italy's flag--red, white, and green--with three kinds of leaves,
each of which has a slightly bitter edge. Italians like to play this
edge against creamy pastas and juicy steaks. A number of other
countries--including Mexico, Ireland, India, and Madagascar--fly
these colors too; the salad could be served with equal patriotic zeal
in 10 nations.

Light-As-Air Buttermilk Pancakes (5 PTS)

none

1 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
2 tablespoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup buttermilk
2 tablespoons drained applesauce
2 large egg whites

In a medium mixing bowl, whisk and stir together the flour, baking powder,
sugar and salt until combined, about 20 seconds. Set aside. Place a medium
non-stick skillet over medium heat and add 1/4 teaspoon vegetable oil.
While the skillet is heating, add the buttermilk, drained applesauce and
egg to a medium mixing bowl and whisk until combined, or about 20-25
seconds. With a rubber spatula fold and stir the flour mixture in until
combined and almost smooth, or about 30 seconds. Fold a paper towel into
eighths and, using it as pad, spread the vegetable oil over the surface of
the skillet. When a few drops of water skitter and dance on the surface of
the skillet, pour a generous half cup of batter into the center. Tip the
skillet gently to spread the batter out a little. Cook until bubbles appear
in the center. Flip over and cook for two minutes more or until the pancake
when pressed in the center, springs back.

Low Fat Banana Bread (3 PTS)

none

1  egg
1/4 cup liquid egg substitute
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons unsweetened applesauce
4  ripe bananas; peeled and mashed
1/2 cup lowfat buttermilk
2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup raisins

Beat the eggs and the brown sugar together until foamy and the sugar is
somewhat dissolved. Stir in the applesauce, bananas and buttermilk mixing
well between each addition. Sift the dry ingredients together and stir into
the liquids along with the raisins. Spray a 9" loaf pan with nonstick spray
and spoon in the batter, smoothing the top out with a spatula. Bake on the
middle rack of a preheated oven until deep golden, the center bounces back
to your touch and a skewer comes out clean (or with crumbs) rather than
wet.
Check the bread after 45 minutes but it will usually take at least one
hour.

LOW FAT CHOCOLATE CAKE (2 PTS)

none

1 1/4 cups flour
1 1/4 cups whole wheat flour; * see note
2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 cups skim milk
2 cups splenda; **see note
2 tablespoons white vinegar
1 teaspoon vanilla
2/3 cup unsweetened applesauce

Beat everything together and put into a 9 x 13 pan sprayed with nonstick
cooking spray.  Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.   Cool and serve with
fat free cool whip and your choice of toppings.

* using all white flour does not change the points, it's close, it does
change the amount of fiber.
** Splenda is made from sugar and is the only low calorie sweetner that can
be used in cooking, or baking and it is ZERO calories.  Using sugar instead
of splenda adds 28 points to the entire recipe.  That would make each
serving 4.2 points.  If Splenda is not available in your area you can order
it online at http://www.splenda.com/

NOTES: You have to try this to believe that it could be 2 points in 1/12th
of a 9x13 pan.  I served it for Easter with 2 T.Cool Whip Free and 1/2 cup
Strawberries per piece for a total of 3 points.  Really good!

2/3 cup sugar
1 1/2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 tablespoon ground espresso
2 cups milk
200 grams amaretti cookies; very finely crushed

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Put the 3/4 cup sugar in a small saucepan and place over moderate heat.
Cook
until sugar dissolves and turns a rich golden-brown, gently swirling
skillet
as necessary to dissolve sugar (don't stir). Add water and stir until
incorporated. Pour caramel into an 8-inch round baking dish or pan.
Beat the eggs with the sugar until light. Stir in cocoa, espresso, milk and
crushed cookies, in that order. Pour mixture into baking dish. Cover with

NO BAKE SUGAR PLUMS (1 PT)

none

2 cups almonds; whole
1/4 cup honey
2 tsp. grated orange peel
1 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp. ground allspice
1/2 tsp. freshly ground nutmeg; or grated
1 cup chopped dried apricots
1 cup pitted dates; finely chopped
1 cup confectioner's sugar

Preheat oven to 400 deg.F.  Arrange almonds on a baking sheet in a single
layer and toast in oven for 10 minutes.  Cool and finely chop (I'll use
food processor).   Meanwhile, combine honey, orange zest, cinnamon,
allspice and nutmeg in a medium bowl. Add almonds, apricots and dates - mix
well.  Pinch off rounded teaspoon size pieces of the mixture and roll into
balls.   (Rinse your hands often, as mixture tends to be sticky).   Roll
balls in sugar then refrigerate in single layers between 2 layers of wax
paper in airtight containers for up to one month.   They taste better if
allowed to sit for several days to let the flavors merge.   These are also
affectionately referred to as "Biker's Bonbons".   This recipe was in this
month's issue ot "Saveur" Magazine and they looked really good and fairly
easy to make.

Makes about 75 bon bons.

Tip
When recipes call for ground turkey or chicken, why not make your own? If
you have a food processor, it will only take a min.-and you can control the
fat content. Use skinless, boneless breasts, and you'll have the leanest
grind possible. Cut into 1" cubes and pulse several times until evenly
ground.

  --- the first 9 ingredients ---
3 Tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
3 Slices bacon; chopped
1 Medium onion; chopped
1 Stalk celery; chopped
1 Medium tomato; chopped
1/2 Head cabbage; shredded
2 Cloves garlic; chopped
1 Pinch chili pepper
1 Pinch dried basil
  --- remaining ingredients ---
1 Quart nonfat chicken broth
6 Ounces pasta; uncooked stivaletti
  salt and pepper
1 Tablespoon fresh parsley; chopped
1 Tablespoon parmesan cheese; grated
  croutons

Place the first 9 ingredients in a soup pot and saute for 10 minutes. Add
the chicken stock and seasonings and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, cook the
pasta in another pot, drain and rinse. Add to the soup and cook for
another 5 minutes. Adjust the seasonings and serve with grated cheese,
parsley and croutons on top.

* Savoy cabbage will produce a milder taste than regular cabbage.
The longer the pasta is in the soup the more liquid it will soak up and
the thicker, and less brothy, it will be.

1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
2 tablespoons dry white wine
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper

Drop the first 3 ingredients into a large saucepan of boiling water; cook
2 minutes. Drain and set aside.

Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; saute 2
minutes or until tender. Remove from heat. Add asparagus mixture,
fettuccine, 1/4 cup cheese, parsley, wine, salt, and pepper; toss well.

NOTES : Drain cooked pasta in a colander over a bowl, holding back about
1/2 cup cooking liquid. Allow the pasta to drain a few minutes,
and then return it to the pot, and toss it with a little of the
reserved cooking liquid; this eliminates the need to add oil to
keep the strands of pasta from sticking. Stir the pasta gently
with the sauce, adding some of the reserved cooking liquid as
needed to keep the pasta moist.

1 1/2 tablespoons orange liqueur
2 teaspoons raspberry-or rosemary-flavored vine
1/2 cup nonfat yogurt cheese*
  Fresh rosemary sprigs (for garnish)

* To prepare yogurt cheese, spoon 3 cups plain nonfat yogurt into a coffee
filter or cheesecloth-lined strainer; place over a bowl.  Refrigerate,
covered, at least 5 hours, or overnight. Discard the liquid in the bowl.

Makes 1 1/2 cups yogurt cheese.

When using rosemary or any fresh herb sprig as a garnish for a dessert or
drink, dip the sprig in ice water and shake off the excess. Then coat the
sprig with granulated sugar, shaking off excess and placing on wax paper;
freeze for 30 minutes. Not only does it make an attractive garnish, it
becomes a flavorful breath freshener, or swizzle stick.

NOTES : Here's an elegant dessert that is reminiscent of the classic Peach
Melba. Our version uses tangy nonfat yogurt cheese
instead of ice cream. The addition of rosemary gives it a complex and
unexpected flavor; one that you would expect to find in
gourmet ice cream.

Perfect Lemon Bars- Cook's Illustrated (2.5 PTS)

none

  THE CRUST:
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
2/3 cup confectioners' sugar; plus extra to decora
1/4 cup cornstarch
3/4 teaspoon salt
12 tablespoons unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks) at v; cut into 1" pieces
  extra  unsalted butter for greasing
  LEMON FILLING:
4 large eggs; beaten lightly
1 1/3 cups granulated sugar
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons finely grated zest from two large l
2/3 cup juice from 3 to 4 large lemons; strained
1/3 cup whole milk
1/8 teaspoon salt

1. For the crust: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350
degrees. Lightly butter a 13-by-9-inch baking dish and line with one sheet
parchment or wax paper. Dot paper with butter, then lay second sheet
crosswise over it.

2. Pulse flour, confectioners' sugar, cornstarch, and salt in food
processor workbowl fitted with steel blade. Add butter and process to
blend, 8 to 10 seconds, then pulse until mixture is pale yellow and
resembles coarse meal, about three 1-second bursts. (To do this by hand,
mix flour, confectioners' sugar, cornstarch, and salt in medium bowl.
Freeze butter and grate it on large holes of box grater into flour mixture.
Toss butter pieces to coat. Rub pieces between your fingers for a minute,
until flour turns pale yellow and coarse.) Sprinkle mixture into lined pan
and press firmly with fingers into even, 1/4-inch layer over entire pan
bottom and about 1/2 inch up sides. Refrigerate for 30 minutes, then bake
until golden brown, about 20 minutes.

3. For the filling: Meanwhile, whisk eggs, sugar, and flour in medium bowl,
then stir in lemon juice, zest, milk, and salt to blend well.

4. To finish the bars: Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees. Stir filling
mixture to reblend; pour into warm crust. Bake until filling feels firm
when touched lightly, about 20 minutes. Transfer pan to wire rack; cool to
near room temperature, at least 30 minutes.Transfer to cutting board, fold
paper down, and cut into serving-size bars, wiping knife or pizza cutter
clean between cuts, as necessary. Sieve confectioners' sugar over bars, if
desired.

NOTES : The challenge: Lemon bars are a casual treat to make without a lot
of fuss. Still, they have their requirements, and we wanted to learn how to
make the best lemon bars possible with a simple and straightforward
recipe. The filling should be light and very lemony, the crust tender,
ready to melt in you mouth. We also wanted everything to come together in a
way that made it possible to cut up the bars cleanly and serve them
neatly. The solution: We tackled the crust first, knowing that our basic
ingredients would be flour, butter, and sugar and that the outcome should
be more like a cookie or a shortbread than a pastry-type crust. This type
of crust generally calls for a fair amount of sugar and no water (which is
wanted in pastry crusts to create pockets of steam that produce flakiness
and layering). White granulated sugar is often the first bakers turn to for
the sort of crust we were after, but we discovered that confectioners'
sugar gave us the most tender texture.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

NOTES : The lemon filling must be added to a warm crust. The 30-minute
chilling and 20-minute baking of the crust should allow plenty of time to
prepare the filling. If not, make the filling first and stir to blend just
before pouring it into the crust. Any leftover bars can be sealed in
plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to two days.

NOTES : Everyone loves the delicious flavor of mouth-watering pizza.
Depending on its ingredients, it can be a nutritional heavyweight.
That is especially true of stuffed pizza. Pizza sauce, cheese and
toppings are stuffed inside two layers of pizza dough. But you can
trim the fat to enjoy the wonderful flavor of a freshly prepared
pizza.

NOTES : Roasting the onions is what gives this dip it's phenomenal flavor.
As you
may know, I am hosting an appetizer get together this holiday season, so
I've slowly been trying different things that I am going to be including on
the menu - THIS is definitely going to make it to the table! I think my
favorite way to serve it is on chunks of fresh soft French bread, though it
WAS good on Melba rounds... It's also great with fresh veggie sticks to dip
in, but the bread... Ah, the bread was my favorite!

Roasted Peppers With Saffron And Basil (.5 PTS)

none

2 large bell peppers (red and yellow); with thick flesh
  extra-virgin olive oil
1  garlic cloves; thinly sliced  (1 to 2)
  salt
  freshly ground pepper
  red wine vinegar; or balsamic vinegar

STOVE TOP GAS BURNER: To roast, set them directly in the flame. Turn them
every few minutes so that the entire surface is exposed to the flame and
the
skin is eventually charred all over. Set the finished peppers in a bowl,
cover it with a plate, and allow it to stand for at least 10 minutes to
steam.

GRILLING: Grill, turning as needed. Once roasted, they can be put into a
covered dish to steam and then finished at your leisure.

BROILER OF AN ELECTRIC OVEN: Set them on the top rack, right under the
heat,
turn them frequently until they are completely charred, then put into a
covered dish to steam and then finished at your leisure.

HOT OVEN: Another way to roast peppers in the oven is to cut them in half,
brush them with light oil on both sides and set them, cut side down, on a
cookie sheet, in a hot oven (400degF). After ten minutes or so the skins
will be wrinkled and loose. Set the pepper halves in a covered bowl to
steam
then peel. Since they haven't been charred, they won't have that smoky
flavor, but they will be softened by the cooking and the skins will be easy
to remove.

PEELING: Carefully scrape away the charred peel with a knife. Save any of
the syrupy juices that collect in the bottom of the bowl. Cut open the
pepper, scrape out the seeds, cut the flesh into strips, and add them to
the
bowl with the juices. Toss with the olive oil, add the garlic, and season
lightly with salt, pepper, and vinegar, to taste. Store in a covered jar in
the refrigerator.

MAKES 2 CUPS, STORE covered and refrigerated for one or two weeks.

USES: They can be cut into wide strips and used as a little hors d'oeuvre
or
salad, garnished with olives, herbs, a splash of vinegar, or thin slices of
Fontina cheese. Cut into thin strips, they can fill a sandwich, garnish a
pizza, or become part of a composed salad. Diced into squares, they can be
tossed with pasta or cooked with rice or millet, as in Millet Pilaf (see
recipe) with Saffron Peppers (see below).

VARIATION:

Roasted Peppers with Saffron and Basil

Roast the peppers as described above and cut them into strips. Warm 1
tablespoon of olive oil, add a pinch of saffron threads, and let stand
until
cooled. Pour over the peppers, add several torn fresh basil leaves, and
toss
together. The saffron flavor will continue to deepen as the peppers sit.

Seared Tofu Burritos With Tomatillo-Chipotle Chile Sauce

none

1/2 pound tomatillos; husked and rinsed
2 medium garlic cloves
1  canned        chipotle chile in ado; drained
  sauce
1/4 cup loosely packed fresh cilantro leave
  Salt
4 teaspoons canola oil
3/4 pound firm or extra-firm lite tofu; cut into 1/2"
  dice
1 medium red bell pepper, cored; seeded/sliced thin
2 cups baby spinach; washed and dried
4 large flour tortillas, each at least 10"
  --
  warmed

Preheat broiler.  Place tomatillos and garlic on rimmed baking sheet and
broil, turning occasionally, until tomatillo skins shrivel and brown in
spots, 6 to 8 minutes.  Set aside to cool briefly.

Place broiled tomatillos and garlic in food processor along with chile
and cilantro.  Pulse until almost smooth.  Add salt to taste.

Meanwhile, heat oil in large nonstick skillet.  Add tofu and cook over
medium-high heat, turning cubes occasionally, until nicely browned,
about 6 minutes.  Transfer tofu to plate lined with paper towels.

Add pepper to empty skillet, reduce heat to medium, and cook, stirring
occasionally until softened, about 5 minutes.

Place some spinach on bottom half of each wrap.  Spoon some bell peppers
and tofu over spinach and then drizzle with tomatillo salsa.  Roll up
wraps, tucking sides toward center to form bundles.  Slice each roll in
half and serve immediately.

4 WW POINTS

Tomatillos, green tomato-like fruits with
papery husks, are broiled to soften their texture and give them a smoky
flavor.  Once softened, they are puréed with garlic, chipotle chile, and
cilantro to make a quick salsa.  In Mexico, this salsa is used to
moisten chicken and seafood, but it's just as good with cubes of browned
tofu.  Canned chipotles in adobo are smoked, dried jalapeños packed in a
vinegary tomato sauce.

slices one on half of circle.  Fold over and seal by pressing edges with
fork. Place on prepared baking sheet, bake 12-15 minutes, until browned.

Spanikopita ( 3 PTS Per Serving 1/4 Of Pita)

none

12 Bags spinach leaves, whole; washed well
3 Pounds leeks; chopped finely
15  green onion, whole; chopped finely
3 Bunches dill; chopped
4 Bunches parsley; tops only
2 Bunches mint leaves
3 Pounds feta cheese; crumbled
3 Boxes filo dough
1 Cup olive oil
  Hand Full     salt

1) Wash and clean all veggies very well!, when clean run gr onions and
leeks
thru food processer.

2) Combine spinach and gr onions and leeks together in sink, you may have
to
put half aside there will be alot!salt well, but not to much since feta is
salty! and mix it around let it sit for at least 30 min or if you are
pressed for time put in container in fridge over night!

3) next we take the veggies and in other sink squeeze as much of liquid out
as we can, this part is not easy and time consuming but if done right you
will have crispy pita and if not they may turn out soggy! First time around
i suggest leaving in fridge over night it does most of the work for ya!

4) When squeezing is done take veggies and put in bowl combine half of feta
and 1/2 cup oil, You can use less..but with my husband being greek much
more
less then this he complains of not tasting the oil!

5)take 2 sheets of fillo spray in between with butter flavored spray. lay a
good sized amount of veggie mix in like a log roll .roll the 2 sides over
and then start rolling , you will almost have a huge boritto shaped pita!

Then wrap in tin foil and freeze laying flat in freezer or to cook
right away 350 - 450 45 min to a hour. Mine is a gas stove and takes a bit
longer ..i like to cook low and for longer to make sure it cooks good
inside!

This makes 11-13 pitas at 3 poinits each serving , 1/4 of pita!
All ingrediants vary points wise  a great deal more than i thought they
would , we buy our stuff from a greek store an dbuy thesame brand so i dont
have to refigure points! you can half this recipe or even 1/4 it but i like
to keep a bunch in freezer, when i have unexpected company for supper i can
pull out and pop in! Hope you enjoy!

I figured points individually so yours may vary, depending on your product!

potatoes are the New England influences, while the tomato base of the stew
and the sherry represent the Portuguese.

Strawberry Bread (3 PTS)

none

  Vegetable oil spray
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
5 large egg whites
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 teaspoons black walnut flavor*
1 packet Butter Buds(r) brand; butter flavored mix
  (never have this so I
  just use butter flavor extract and
  applesauce!)
2 1/4 cups granulated sugar
1 cup drained; unsweetened
  applesauce (drain in a colander lin
  with a
  paper towel until not so 'wet')
2 1/2 cups fresh strawberries; sliced thick
1/4 cup fine chopped walnuts

Set the oven rack to the middle and preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
Lightly spray the interior bottom and sides of two 9-by-5-by-3-inch loaf
pans with the vegetable oil. Dust with flour, knocking out excess. Set
aside. In a medium mixing bowl whisk or stir the flour, cinnamon, baking
soda and salt together. Set aside. In a large mixing bowl of an electric
mixer, beat the egg and egg whites on medium speed until frothy about 30
seconds. Stop the mixer. Add the vanilla, black walnut flavor, Butter Buds,
applesauce and sugar, and mix on medium speed until the sugar seems to
dissolve. By hand, stir in the strawberries. Add the dry ingredients,
stirring until just moistened, about 20 seconds. The batter will appear
slightly lumpy. Divide the batter equally between the prepared loaf pans.
Dust the top of each with 1/4-cup of the walnuts. Bake for 60 minutes or
until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool in the pans
on wire racks for 5 minutes. Lift the breads out onto a wire rack and cool
completely.

JaneStarr's Freezer Suggestions:
Prepare as above in steps 3 & 4.  Place chicken (or ground beef, if you
choose) mixture in a freezer zip-loc bag and freeze.  Thaw
in refrigerator the night before serving.  Continue with the rest of the
directions.  Bake in a pre-heated 350° F oven for 25-30
minutes(until hot throughout dish).

Alternate Suggestion.  Prepare casserole through step 6 prior to freezing.
Thaw overnight .  Top with cheese and bake as directed.

I doubled  this recipe and switched from an 8X8 to a 9X13" pan. YUM!!

Tomato Vegetable Soup (2 PTS)

none

6 cups tomato puree
6 cups fat-free chicken broth
1 large onion; chopped
2 stalks celery; chopped
3 large garlic cloves; minced
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup carrots; chopped
1 medium zucchini; chopped
1 1/2 c corn
4 medium potatoes; chopped
4 medium tomatoes; peeled and seeded
  -- and chopped
1/2 cup fresh basil leaves; chopped
1 tablespoon fresh thyme; minced
2  bay leaves
  salt and pepper

Saute onions, celery and garlic in the olive oil in the bottom of a
dutch oven or other soup pot. When tender, add remaining ingredients.
Simmer 15-20 minutes until vegetables are tender.

NOTES: I had a lot of tomatoes from the garden, so I whizzed them in the
blender, then strained out the skin and seeds. It came out the consistency
somewhere between sauce and juice. I guess you could use a combo of these
if you didn't want to make your own. Or use V-8.
You can use any veggies you want. I actually added broccoli stems the
first time I made it. I peeled them them chopped them up and dumped them
in.
1/4 - 1/2 cup of small pasta shapes per serving is good with this, too,
but cook it separately and add to soup in the serving bowl. If you add it
to the soup kettle, it will soak up all the juice and get mushy.
This freezes really well. I put it in 2-cup deli containers and had
lunches ready for a week!

Serving Ideas : 2 points per 2 cup serving (without pasta)

NOTES : Roasting the peaches brings out their natural sweetness and makes
them
soft and easy to peel. But if you want to bypass that step, just use very
ripe peeled peaches, and purée them with the honey.

White Chili (5 PTS)

none

2 pounds chicken breasts; no skin, no bone
2  onions; chopped
2 1/2 cups chicken broth; canned or homemade
1 can green chiles; chopped
1 can tomatillos
2 teaspoon each:  cumin and garlic powder
1 teaspoon oregano
3 cups white beans; cooked -- canned or
  make yourself
1/2 bunch cilantro; chopped--optional
1 pound lowfat jack cheese; grated

In a large saucepan, heat a small amount of oil and saute the onion.  When
the onion is translucent, add chicken. Cook for a couple of minutes, max.
Don't let it stick and don't add a ton of oil to keep it cooking either.

Add everything else, except the cilantro and cheese.  If you want, after
sauteeing the chicken and onion together, finish the recipe in a crock pot.
If you do, cook on high for about 3 hours or so, if you want it to cook all
day, put it on low.  You just need to get it nice and hot.  If you are
doing
this on the stove top, simmer for about 20 minutes.

Serve in nice big bowls, sprinkle with cilantro if you like, and some
grated
cheese.  Served with buttermilk cornbread and a big salad, this is a
wonderful meal.

WW MAGIC FUDGE (1 PT)

none

14 1/2 ounces fat free sweetened condensed milk
12 ounces reduced fat chocolate chips

Melk together and poor into an 8x8 pan. Cool in fridge for one hour.

Yield: 64 pieces.

VARIATION:
For a low fat version, I used fat free sweetened condensed milk and reduced
fat chocolate chips.  For those of you who might follow WW, that's one
point
each. I think it comes out to about slightly more than on gram per piece.

WW Recipe Adaptation Veggie Soup

none

1 cup diced onion
8 teaspoons instant chicken broth granules or
8 packets instant chicken broth & seasoning m
8 cloves minced garlic; (equal to 4 tsp.)
9 cups assorted sliced veggies; *see Note
1  tomato; seeded & chopped
4 teaspoons fresh parsley; chopped (or 1 tsp
  dried)
1 teaspoon dried basil leaves; ( I prefer 1Tb
  fresh)
1/2 teaspoon pepper; (I use a bit less
  of restaurant grind)

INSTRUCTIONS:
1). Spray large (5+ Quart), non-stick saucepan lightly with Pam. Saute
onions
over medium heat until almost translucent.  Add garlic and dry chicken mix.
Continue cooking until onion is translucent. ( I like my onions lightly
browned).

2). Stir in remaining ingredients.  Cover and cook over low heat for about
10
minutes.

3). Add 8 cups of water and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat, cover and simmer
about 20 minutes (until vegetables are soft).

4). Use a slotted spoon to remove about 2 cups of vegetables from pan;
set aside.

5). Allow soup to cool to room temperature.  Puree remaining soup in a
blender
in small batches. (I plan to use my new hand blender right in the pot)

6). Return pureed mixture and reserved vegetables to saucepan and heat.
Enjoy as an unlimited vegetable on the Weight Watchers plan!

This soup is especially good with 7 - 8 fat-free cracked pepper crackers
(which count as one bread serving/point).

I like to microwave 1 1/2 cups of this soup for about 2 minutes (150 °F)
and
eat with the crackers about 30 minutes before lunch.

Per MasterCook: 69 cals, 1g fat (14% CFF), 4g fiber

This is a "free food" per WW leaders and materials.  Enjoy!

oven to 375°.  Place squash halves, cavity side down, on a baking pan with
sides lined with foil.  Add 1/2 cup water to pan and bake squash 35
minutes
until almost cooked through.  Set squash aside.
Heat oil over medium heat in a large skillet.  Add onions, celery, garlic,
thyme and oregano and saute 3 minutes until vegetables are tender.  Add
the
Gimme Lean, crumbling it with your fingers as you put it into pan so it
resembles ground beef.  Cook 2 minutes, add white beans, walnuts, tamari
and
parsley.  Combine mixture well.  Season with salt and pepper.
Turn squash cut side up and divide stuffing evenly among squash halves.
Pack stuffing in and mound top about 2 inches above squash
surface, pressing lightly.  You can top each squash half with 1
tablespoon soy cheese or mozzarella cheese, if desired.  Place
stuffed squash back on a baking dish, add 1/2 cup water to pan to
prevent sticking and bake, uncovered, 10 minutes until heated through.

*Gimme Lean is a soy-based "ground beef."  It comes in a 14-ounce tube or

food stores.

Baked Onion Fans (1 PT)

none

6 medium size red onions
1 cup balsamic vinegar
  Freshly ground black pepper to tast

Preheat the oven to 350. Brush off any loose pieces of skin, but otherwise
leave the onions unpeeled. Cut the onions in half from the root end
through
the stem. Place the halves, cut side down, in a glass baking dish just
large
enough to hold them comfortably. Pour the vinegar over the onions sand
cover
the dish tightly with foil. Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the onions
are
fork tender. When they are cool enough to handle, remove the skins but be
sure to leave the roots intact. Cut each onion half in half again to make
quarters. Place the onion quarters in a shallow dish, cover and
refrigerate
until serving time. Before serving, fan the layers of each onion quarter
slightly. Serve at room temperature or slightly warm, sprinkled with
pepper.

Basic Baked Potatoes (5 PTS)

none

4  Idaho potatoes (10 oz each)

Scrub potatoes thoroughly and pierce all over with fork.  Line microwave
oven floor with paper towels and arrange potatoes on top, in an evenly
spaced pattern. Microwave on high 5 minutes ; turn and rearrange potatoes
and microwave 5 minutes more.  Repeat until potatoes feel nearly soft, 5-8
minutes more.  Let stand 5 minutes.  (May be done up to two days ahead;
cool to room temperature, wrap in plastic and refrigerate until ready to
use.)

When potatoes are cool enough to handle, preheat oven to 375 oF.

Cut an 'x' into the top of each potato.  Scoop out most of the potato
flesh, leaving a thick potato "shell".  Chop each potato's flesh and place
each in it's own small bowl.  Combine potato insides with add-ons as
desired (see recipes).

Arrange stuffed potatoes in medium baking pan; bake until heated through,
about 15 minutes.

Serving (1 potato) provides: 2 breads.

Note: Bake the potatoes up to 2 days ahead (or in the morning, while your
having breakfast), and just warm them in the microwave 2-3 minutes before
serving.  Chop and assemble the toppings in small bowls (buy already
shredded cheese and cooked broccoli from the salad bar to save time).
Then, give everyone a warm potato and let them have free rein with the
toppings.

Suggested add-ons: Chopped steamed broccoli, part-skim ricotta cheese,
nonfat sour cream, thawed frozen chopped spinach, salsa, shredded cheese,
crumbled feta cheese, chopped tomatoes.

Note: Harvest's Health Champions September 2000

The tomato paste used in this recipe is a concentrated source of lycopene,
with 28 mg per 1/4 cup (50 mL) compared with 3 mg in 1 raw tomato. It is
also noteworthy that research indicates lycopene from cooked or processed
tomatoes is more readily absorbed by the body, especially if cooked with
olive oil.

Bouillabaisse (Southern French Soup) (6 PTS)

none

5 pounds fish***
4 tablespoons olive oil
3  onions; chopped
1  fennel bulb; chopped
3  tomatoes; chopped
2 cloves garlic; crushed
1  bay leaf
1/2 cup fresh parsley; finely snipped
1/4 teaspoon saffron
2 quarts water; boiling (2 to 3)
  Salt
  Boiled potatoes; optional

***(mix of whole fish: monkfish, swordfish, halibut,
flounder, sea bass, red snapper or whatever fish you enjoy) save
trimmings (head, bones and tails)

In large soup pot, heat olive oil on medium-high heat. Add vegetables
and sauté for 5 minutes until they begin to soften. In other pot,
bring water to boil. When water is boiling, add fish trimmings to
vegetables; add boiling water and salt. Cover and cook at a boil until
broth has reduced and thickened. (You want it to be an orangy red
color). Approximately 45 minutes.

Strain soup and discard solid pieces. This can be made in advance and
reheated later. It can also be frozen.

Boil potatoes if using and set aside. Return broth to soup pot; add
fish filets cut into chunks saffron and parsley. Bring to gentle
simmer and cook until fish is cooked all the way through.
Approximately 10 minutes. Add potatoes. Serve immediately.

You can also serve this with slices of toasted, crusty peasant bread
in the bottom of each bowl. Top with fish pieces then broth.

The trick to good fish soup is what the French refer to as "fumet de
poisson"; this is the stock made from cooking the bones and other
trimmings together with some vegetables. It is strained then used as
the base of the soup. So don't be turned off by cooking the bones, it
will enrich the soup.

Bread, Favorite Homemade (3 PTS)

none

3 packages active dry yeast
3 1/4 cups warm water
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 cup vegetable oil
4 teaspoons salt
7 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
3 cups whole wheat flour

Combine yeast, 1 C of the warm water and the sugar in a large bowl; stir
until the yeast is dissolved. Let stand until mixture is foamy, about 10
min.

Stir remaining warm water, the oil and salt into yeast mixture.

Whisk together 7 C of the all-purpose flour and the whole wheat flour in a
large bowl until combined.

Make a well in the center of the flour mixture. Add half of the yeast
liquid
to the well; stir into the flour mixture to blend. Stir in the remaining
yeast liquid until a rough mass is formed.

Turn dough out on floured surface; this is a very soft dough. Knead until
smooth and elastic, about 5 min, adding as much of the remaining 1/4C
all-purpose flour as needed to prevent sticking.

Place dough in lightly oiled bowl; turn dough in bowl so all sides are
coated. Cover bowl with towel or lightly greased waxed paper. Let rise in
a
warm place, away from drafts, for 45 - 50 min or until dough doubles in
volume.

Grease three 9 x 5 x 3" loaf pans.

Punch dough down. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Knead
lightly. Divide into thirds. Place one portion in each of the prepared
pans.
Cover with a damp towel or lightly greased waxed paper. Let rise in warm
place, away from drafts, until doubled in volume, for 30 - 45 min.

To bake, heat oven to 400F. Bake bread for 25 min or until hollow sounding
when lightly tapped. Turn loaves out onto wire racks and let cool
completely.

Broccoli needs to be cooked until quite soft.
It may also be put in a food processor to reduce
to a mushy consistency and then placed in soup.
Kathy writes: I've searched a very long time for a
good Broccoli Cream Soup recipe.  When I found this
one, I knew I'd found it.

Butternut-Oatmeal Bread (2 PTS)

none

2 packages active dry yeast(package)
1 1/4 cups warm water; (105° to 115°)
5 1/2 cups bread flour; (5-1/2-5-3/4),
  divided
1 1/4 cups butternut squash; mashed & cooked
  (1 medium)
3 tablespoons molasses
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 cup quick-cooking oats; plus
2 tablespoons quick-cooking oats

warm place (85°), free from drafts, 35 minutes or until doubled in bulk.

Punch dough down; divide in half. Turn 1 portion out onto work surface;
knead 4 or 5 times.  Roll into a 14 x 7 inch rectangle.  Roll up, staring
at
short side, pressing firmly to eliminate air pockets; pinch ends to seal.
Place dough, seam side down, in an 8-1/2 x 4 -1/2 inch loafpan coated with
cooking spray and sprinkle with 1 1/2 teaspoons oats.  Repeat procedure
with
remaining dough and 1 1/2 teaspoons oats.

Brush loaves evenly with 1 tablespoon water, and sprinkle evenly with
remaining 1 tablespoon oats.  Cover and let rise in a warm place free from
drafts, 25 minutes or until doubled in bulk.  Bake at 350° for 35 minutes
or
until loaves sound hollow when tapped.  Remove from pans immediately; cool
on wire rack.

Yield:  2 loaves or 16 (1/2 inch) slices per loaf.

Cranberry Pumpkin Bread #2 (6 PTS)

none

1/2 cup oil  (or 1 stick butter melted)
2  eggs
1 cup sugar
1 cup solid pack pumpkin
2/3 cup whole berry jellied cranberry sauce
1 1/2 cups flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg
1/8 teaspoon cloves

Combine all ingredients in food processor and process for five seconds.
Scrape down and pulse to combine 1 or 2 times. Do not overprocess. If you
don't have a processor, you could probably just stir this up by hand.

Spray with Pam (or lightly but thoroughly grease) an 8" loaf pan. Spoon
batter into pan. Bake for approx. 1 hr. and ten minutes in 350 F oven. You
may need to tent foil over the top after it has been in the oven for about
30 minutes to keep it from getting too dark before the bread is done. Test
with a skewer to be sure it's baked all the way through.

Cranberry-Orange Swirl Muffins (5.5 PTS)

none

  Butter for the pans
  **cranberry-orange mixture**
1 1/2 cups fresh cranberries (may substitute f; thawed)
  --cranberries
1/2 cup sweet (not Seville) orange marmalad
1/3 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon finely grated orange zest
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
  Generous 1/4 teaspoon ground cardam
  **batter**
2 1/4 cups flour
2 1/4 teaspoons baking powder
  Generous 1/2 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons unsalted butter; at room temperature
2/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar
1 large egg
1 1/4 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon finely grated orange zest
1 cup low-fat or whole milk

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Generously butter 12 standard-sized
muffin cups or line them with paper liners.

For the cranberry-orange mixture: In a blender or a food processor,
combine the cranberries, marmalade, sugar, orange zest, cinnamon and
cardamom and process until the cranberries are coarsely chopped.
Scrape the mixture into a small saucepan and heat over medium heat
until the mixture comes to a boil, about 5 minutes. Or scrape the
mixture into a large microwave-safe bowl, cover loosely with wax
paper and microwave on full power, stopping to stir every 2 minutes,
until the mixture is bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes. Set aside to cool
slightly.

For the batter: In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and
salt. Set aside.

In a medium bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed, beat
together the butter and 2/3 cup of the sugar until combined. Add the
egg and mix until light and fluffy, about 1 minute. Add the vanilla
and orange zest and mix until smooth. Using a spoon, stir 1/2 of the
flour mixture into the bowl, then stir in the milk, finally stir in
the remaining flour mixture, and mix just until the batter is smooth.

Transfer 1/4 cup of the batter to the cranberry-orange mixture and
mix to combine; set aside.

Transfer 1/3 of the plain batter to a small bowl; set aside. Divide
the remaining plain batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups, a
scant 2 tablespoons per cup. Then divide the cranberry batter evenly
among the muffin cups, 1 to 2 tablespoons per cup. Top each muffin
with a spoonful of the reserved plain batter. If desired, swirl the
batter and cranberry filling together lightly with a knife or a
toothpick. Sprinkle the muffins with the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar.

Bake the muffins in the preheated oven for 13 to 15 minutes, until
they are barely golden on top and springy to the touch. Transfer the
muffin tin to a wire rack to cool for about 3 minutes. Using a knife,
loosen the muffins from the tin and transfer them to a wire rack to
cool completely.

* Note: Marmalade made from Seville oranges will be too bitter for this
recipe.

These muffins are swirled with a bright cranberry filling. It's best

sticking to the tins.

Creamy Coleslaw (5 Points)

  **FOR THE DRESSING**
2 cups mayonnaise
2 tablespoons cider vinegar
2 tablespoons sugar
1 teaspoon garlic; minced
1 teaspoon ground white pepper
1 teaspoon salt
  **FOR THE CABBAGE MIX**
5 large carrots (1 1/2 lbs); peeled and shredded
1 head green cabbage (about 2 lbs); shredded (about 12
  cups)

To make dressing: In a small bowl, mix together the mayonnaise, vinegar,
sugar, garlic, pepper and salt. Set aside.

To make cabbage mix: In a large bowl, toss the carrots and cabbage.
Immediately pour the dressing over the cabbage mix and toss until all of
the
vegetables are well coated. Cover the bowl and refrigerate until the
vegetables wilt just a little, about 15 minutes. (The flavors blend even
better if you let the slaw marinate in the refrigerator for about 1 hour.)

Toss again before serving to redistribute any dressing that has settled in
the bottom of the bowl.

Makes 3 quarts.

SOURCE;  More Bread Machine Magic by Linda Rehberg and Lois Conway,
copyright 1997, ISBN #0-312-16935-3. MM format by Ursula R. Taylor.

Note just above the recipe says that this bread was inspired by fond
memories of Linda's Dad sitting at the table pouring milk over his
rice and putting cinnamon & sugar on top.

Also notes to watch dough ball as it varies each time you make it and
that if you use freshly cooked rice you will need to add extra liquid.

1. Place all ingredients except raisins in bread pan, using the least
amount of liquid listed in the recipe. Select Light Crust setting and
Raisin/Nut cycle. Press start.

2. Observe the dough as it kneads.  After 5 to 10 minutes, if it appears
dry & stiff or if your machine sounds as if it's straining to knead it,
add
more liquid 1 tbsp. at a time until dough forms a smooth, soft, pliable
ball
that is slightly tacky to the touch.

3.  At the beep, add the raisins.

4. After the baking cycle ends, remove bread from pan, place on cake
rack, & allow to cool 1 hour before slicing.

CRUST: Light -- BAKE CYCLE: Raisin/nut ~- OPTIONAL BAKE

Dmn Meringue Shortcakes With Blueberries (10 PTS)

none

6  Egg whites
1 pn Cream of tartar
1 3/4 c Sugar; (divided use)
1 tb Unsalted butter
3 c Blueberries
1/4 c Brandy
1/2 t Ground cinnamon
1/4 t Ground nutmeg
1/4 t Ground ginger
3/4 c Heavy cream; whipped

Preheat oven to 250 F. Whip egg on high speed until
foamy. Add cream of tartar and mix well. With machine
running, add 1/4 cups sugar, about 1 tablespoon at a
time. Once incorporated, continue to mix until whites
are shiny and hold a stiff peak.

Place meringue in a piping bag fitted with a large
star tip. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Pipe 8 (4-inch) circles onto the parchment. If you
like, you can draw circles on the paper to ensure they
are even. Bake about 1 hour or until meringues are dry
and crisp. Turn oven off and allow meringues to cool
in oven. Remove and set aside.

Heat butter in: a large sauté pan until bubbling. Add
blueberries and sauté until they start to soften, 2 to
3 minutes. Add remaining 1/2 cup sugar and brandy and
cook until sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes. Add
cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger and mix with berries.
Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.

To assemble, place one of the meringue layers on each
of 4 plates. Top with about 1/3 cup of the blueberry
filling, using about half of it in all. Add a bit of
the whipped cream, then top with another meringue
layer. Finish with more filling, and then the last of
the whipped cream. Serve immediately. Makes 4 servings.

GREEN BEAN AND VEGETABLE RAGOUT (3 PTS)

none

4  carrots
4  parsnips
1 bulb fennel
1 pound Blue Lake beans
1 tablespoon chopped garlic
1 tablespoon chopped thyme
1 tablespoon chopped parsley
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon pepper
4 tablespoons butter; (1/2 stick)

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Start a pot of boiling water big
enough to hold twice the amount of beans. Season the water heavily
with salt.

2. Peel carrots and parsnips. Remove just the stalk end of the green
beans by snapping or cutting them off. Cut the carrot, parsnips and
fennel into batons (french-fry cut), about the same size as the green
beans.

3. Toss the carrots, parsnips and fennel with the chopped garlic,
thyme, parsley, olive oil, salt and pepper. Spread on a cookie sheet
or roasting pan and cook in the oven for 10-15 minutes, or until just
tender.

8. During the last two minutes the vegetables are roasting, drop the
green beans into the salted boiling water and cook for two minutes
and strain. (You can also pre-roast the veggies and blanch the beans
ahead, then reheat them all together in the oven 5 to 10 minutes
before serving time.)

9. Remove vegetables from oven and place in a bowl. Add beans and
toss with butter. Adjust seasoning to taste and serve.

Serves 8-12

For ease and consistency, Frank Palmer, executive chef at the
Lafayette Park Hotel, recommends using a mandoline to cut the veggies.

1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice (generous tsp.)
2 cups fresh cranberries (substitute froze; finely chopped (may

1 tablespoon unsalted butter; cold, cut into small
  --bits
  **TOPPING**
3/4 cup flour
2/3 cup packed light brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
5 tablespoons unsalted butter; cut into bits

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Lightly coat a 9-by-13-inch baking
dish with the spray oil.

For the filling: In a large bowl, combine the sugar, cinnamon,
allspice and cranberries. Add the apples, pears, bread and cranberry
juice cocktail and toss to coat. Spread the mixture evenly in the
prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with the butter. Bake for 10 minutes.

For the topping: In a food processor or a blender, combine the flour,
sugar and cinnamon and pulse to mix. Sprinkle the butter over the
mixture and process until well blended, about 1 minute.
Alternatively, in a bowl, stir together flour, sugar and cinnamon.
With fingers or forks, work butter into dry ingredients until mixture

Betty recipes started turning up in 19th-century America. Early
versions usually called for several layers of fruit and bread cubes
and were rather puddinglike. I prefer to spread the fruit and bread
in a single layer and bake in a flat dish, which, while less
traditional, produces a crispier texture.

Hot Dungeness Crab Appetizer (5.5 Points)

none

2 cups thawed frozen artichoke hearts; rinsed and drained
1 cup onions; chopped
8 ounces cooked Dungeness crabmeat (about 1; rinsed
3/4 cup part-skim rocotta cheese
1/2 cup evaporated skimmed milk
1/2 cup non-fat mayonnaise*
1 1/2 ounces Parmesan cheese; grated
  Italian parsley; minced, for garnish

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray four 1-cup ramekins or an 8 x 8 inch
baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.

In medium bowl, combine artichoke hearts, onion, crabmeat, ricotta, milk
and
mayonnaise; mix well. Divide between prepared ramekins (or place in
prepared
baking dish) and sprinkle evenly with Parmesan cheese. Bake, uncovered,
until bubbling and lightly browned, 20-25 minutes. Garnish with parsley
and
serve immediately.

~Kris Swanson-Schones of Prior Lake, Minnesota, wanted to duplicate her
favorite appetizer at Kincaid's in Saint Paul. Writes Kris, "It's
wonderful...and I can make a meal of it alone with bread."

NOTES : We found that when rounded out with bread and some steamed
vegetables, this generous portion of creamy seafood could easily make a
main
dish. The original dish called for two cups of mayonnaise; we substituted
nonfat mayo and part-skim ricotta cheese. We also compensated by doubling
up
on the veggies. Our final touch: taking the Parmesan cheese out of the
dish
and sprinkling it on top instead...its flavor came through in every bite.
(Note: If Dungeness crab is unavailable, you can also substitute rinsed
canned lump crabmeat or surimi.)

Italian Meat Loaf (4.5 PTS)

none

2  egg whites; lightly beaten
2 cloves garlic; minced
3/4 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper
1 medium apple; peeled, cored and
  finely shredded
1/2 cup chopped onions
1/2 cup fine dry seasoned bread crumbs
1 pound ground turkey breast (see note)
2/3 cup reduced-fat spaghetti sauce
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, stir together the egg
whites, garlic, basil, salt, rosemary and red pepper. Then stir in the
apples, onions and bread crumbs. Add the turkey and mix until well
combined. Spray a 7 1/2-by-3 1/2-by-2-inch or 8-by-4-by-2-inch loaf pan
with no-stick spray. Pat the turkey mixture into the pan. Bake for 15
minutes. Spread the spaghetti sauce over the top of the turkey. Bake about
25 minutes more or until the turkey is no longer pink. Let stand for 5
minutes. Transfer the loaf to a serving plate. Sprinkle the Parmesan
cheese over the top. Slice and serve.

Note: To make sure you're buying the leanest ground turkey available,
check the label. Look for products made with only turkey breast meat. Many
ground turkey products contain the dark meat and the fatty skin.

Lime-Marinated Snapper With Tomato-Caper Sauce (2.5 PTS)

none

4 fillets red snapper; (1 1/2 pounds)
  Salt
  Ground white pepper
1/4 cup fresh lime juice; (from 1 large lime)
1 medium onion; sliced thin
3 medium tomatoes; peeled, seeded, and
1/4 cup green chiles; minced
1 tablespoon capers; drained
4 ounces roasted red peppers; sliced thin

TO PREPARE: Place the snapper fillets in a large nonreactive baking dish;
sprinkle the fillets with 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon white pepper,
and lime juice. Let them stand 15 minutes.

TO COOK: Meanwhile, bring 1/4 cup water to boil in a large skillet. Add
onions; cover and simmer until softened, about 7 minutes.

Add the tomatoes, minced green chiles, capers, and 1/4 cup of the roasted
red peppers; cover and simmer until the tomatoes release their juice and
flavors blend, about 7 minutes. Add red snapper fillets; cover and simmer
5 minutes. Turn fillets and simmer, uncovered, until fillets are opaque
throughout, about 4 minutes longer.

TO SERVE: Transfer a red snapper fillet to each warm dinner plate. Spoon
some sauce over each portion and garnish with remaining roasted red
peppers. Serve immediately.

Marinating red snapper fillets in lime juice enhances their flavor without
adding calories. A salad of curly endive and thinly sliced fennel rounds
out this light, Mediterranean-style fish dinner.

1  (5 pound) bone-in skinless turkey b
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon fresh-ground black pepper
3/4 cup pure maple syrup
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
  **Mushroom stuffing**
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
2  onions; chopped
1  celery rib; chopped
1  carrot; peeled and chopped
3  garlic cloves; minced
1  Granny Smith apple; cored and chopped
1 pound white mushrooms; chopped
1/2 pound shiitake mushrooms; chopped
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup sherry
2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage; *or*
2 teaspoons dried sage

1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 1/2 pounds firm white bread; cut in 1"cubes,dried
1 can low-sodium chicken broth; (14.5 oz)
1/2 teaspoon fresh-ground black pepper

To make turkey:  Preheat oven to 400°.  Place turkey breast on a rack in a
roasting pan and sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Roast 15 minutes, then
reduce heat to 350° and roast another 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, combine maple syrup, vanilla, nutmeg and allspice in a saucepan
and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer 3 to 5 minutes until liquid
is
reduced by about one-fourth.  After first 45 minutes of roasting, brush
turkey with glaze.  Roast 15 minutes more and brush with glaze.  Roast 10
minutes more and glaze again.  Roast 5 minutes, brush with remaining
glaze,
and continue roasting 5 to 10 minutes until an instant-read thermometer
inserted in the thickest part registers 180°.

To make stuffing:  Meanwhile, spray a 3-quart baking dish with no-stick
cooking spray.  Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add
onions, celery, carrot and garlic, and saute 7 to 8 minutes until
vegetables begin
to soften.  Stir in apples and cook 3 minutes.  Add white and shiitake
mushrooms and 1/4 teaspoon salt; saute 6 minutes until mushrooms begin to
give off
their liquid and soften.  Stir in sherry, sage and thyme; cook 2 to 3
minutes until liquid has evaporated.  Remove from heat.
Combine vegetable mixture, bread cubes, broth, remaining 1/2 teaspoon
salt,
and pepper in a large bowl.  Toss well to combine and transfer to baking
dish.  Cover dish with foil.  After turkey has roasted 1 hour, place
stuffing in oven and bake 15 minutes.  Remove foil and bake 15 to 20
minutes until
stuffing is heated through and crisp on top.

Makes 12 servings of turkey and stuffing.

MARK MILLER'S PEAR SALSA (1 PT)

1 teaspoon sugar
3  plum tomatoes; roasted and diced
1 small poblano chile; roasted, peeled,
  --seeded, and diced
1 small red bell pepper; roasted, peeled,

1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar

1. Heat the oil in a pan and sauté the pears with the sugar over
medium-low heat for 2 minutes. Transfer to a mixing bowl. Thoroughly
combine with all the remaining ingredients.

Note: To roast peppers: Position the broiler rack about 4 inches from
the heat source and preheat the broiler. Place a sheet of foil on a
baking sheet and place the pepper on it. Broil, turning with tongs as
it blackens, until evenly charred, about 20 minutes. Fold the foil up
over the pepper and seal. As it cools, the skin will loosen.

pitted and sliced kalamatas to the mix.

Midwestern Corn Chowder (2 PTS)

none

3/4 cup onion; chopped
1 teaspoon butter
1/4 cup dry sherry
1 cup celery; chopped
2 cups red potatoes; diced
1  bay leaf
2 cups fat-free chicken broth
2 cups tomatoes; chopped
1 1/2 cups corn kernels
1 1/2 cups skim milk
1/2 cup parsley; chopped
  ground pepper (optional)

To lower the calories in the soup, nonfat milk and potato puree replace
the
rich cream base used in traditional recipes. This soup freezes
beautifully, so
make a double batch, especially when corn is at its peak.

In a large stockpot over med-high heat, saute onion in butter and sherry
until
soft but not browned. Add celery and potatoes and saute for 2 min. Crush
bay
leaf and wrap in cheesecloth or place in a tea ball. Add stock and bay
leaf to
soup and bring to a boil.

Lower heat to simmer and cook, covered, until potatoes are tender (20
min).
Remove bay leaf and discard. Place 2 C of the soup in a blender and puree.

Return to pot. Add tomatoes, corn, and milk, and bring to a boil again.
Lower heat and simmer for 5 min. Add parsley, taste for seasoning, and add

pepper (if desired).

Measure carefully, adding ingredients in bread machine pan in the
order recommended by the manufacturer - except cherries, raisins or
currants and almonds.  Select Sweet or Basic/White cycle.  Use Light
or Medium crust color.  Add red and green candied cherries, raisins
or currants, and almonds at the raisin/nut cycle or 5 minutes before
last kneading cycle ends.  The dough becomes VERY SOFT and WET in
appearance at this point! DO NOT add flour, as the bread will become
tough.

Remove baked bread from pan and cool on wire rack.

NOTES : Selection:
Hachiya persimmons are elongated, pointy persimmons, which are
usually astringent until they are so ripe they are squishy.  The
fuyu persimmon is very sweet, even when firm and crisp.  Round and
shaped like a tomato, they are firm enough to be eaten like an
apple.

Preparation:
Persimmons are luscious raw, and rinsing them is all you need to
do.  There are a few large seeds, which can be easily removed.
Peel and slice the firmer fuyu persimmons for fruit salads.  For
the softer hachiya, cut off the top and eat the pulp out of hand
with a spoon.

3/4 cup chopped salted peanuts
1/2 cup peanut butter; creamy or crunchy
1/2 cup firm-packed light brown sugar

low
heat.  Stir constantly until mixture is smooth and just starts to boil.
Stir in vanilla and pour over cereal mixture.  Toss gently to mix well.

Prune Banana Muffins With Cranberry Spread (4.5 PTS)

none

  **MUFFINS**
1 cup mashed bananas
1/2 cup plain nonfat yogurt
1/2 cup bran
1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup prunes; pitted and chopped
1/2 cup molasses
1/4 cup oil
1/4 cup fat-free egg substitute
  **CRANBERRY SPREAD**
12 ounces cranberries; whole
1 cup apple juice
1/2 cup maple syrup
1/2 cup raisins

MUFFINS: In a SMALL bowl mix the bananas, yogurt and bran. In a LARGE bowl
sift together the flour, baking power, baking soda, and cinnamon. Add
coarsely chopped prunes and toss to coat. In another small bowl, combine
the
molasses, oil and eggs. Pour the egg mixture and then the banana mixture
into the flour mixture. Carefully fold together with a rubber spatula
until
just blended; do no over mix.

Coat 12 muffin cups with no-stick spray. Spoon the batter into the cups,
filling them about two-thirds. Bake at 400F for 20 to 25 minutes, or until
the edges pull away from the sides of the cups.

CRANBERRY SPREAD: In a 2 quart saucepan combine the cranberries, juice,
syrup and raisins. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to
medium
and cook until the mixture is thickened and reduced, about 15 minutes.
Stir
the mixture occasionally as it cooks and press on the cranberries to break
them (the way we would cherry pie filling). Spoon the spread into small
jars. Cool, cover and refrigerate. Makes 2 cups.

Muffin variation: other dried fruits, such as apricots, peaches, currants.
(no points figured for variation)

Pumpkin Custard (3 PTS)

none

4 1/2 cups nonfat milk
2 1/4 cups egg substitute
2 cups pumpkin puree
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice

Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Whisk all ingredients together making sure
that
sugar is dissolved before you begin baking. Spray inside of individual
ramekins or custard cups with nonstick spray and fill each 3/4 full with
custard mixture. Place ramekins in a larger baking dish that will allow
for
water to come at least halfway up the side of the ramekins. Fill large
baking dish with boiling water and cover the top of the ramekins with
parchment paper sprayed with nonstick spray. Place two utensils or metal
skewers on top of the parchment to keep from curling off in the oven. Bake
for 25-30 minutes before checking with a skewer or fork tines to see if
custard is cooked. The custard will continue to cook some as it cools so
don't over cook. Serve with fresh berries, papaya or other fresh fruit.

Slim Chocolate Cheesecake Pie (3.5 PTS)

none

  ***CRUST***
1 cup graham cracker crumbs
1 tablespoon sugar
  ***CHEESECAKE***
15 ounces light ricotta cheese
1 cup sugar
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa
8 ounces Neufchatel cream cheese; softened
1/2 cup frozen fat-free egg product; thawed OR
2  egg whites
1/3 cup skim milk; or 2% milk
2 teaspoons vanilla
  ***TRIPLE FRUIT TOPPING***
1 cup orange juice
4 teaspoons cornstarch
22 ounces mandarin orange sections; drained
2  kiwifruits; peeled, sliced
1 cup strawberries; sliced

Satisfy your chocolate craving and maintain your goal of reduced fat with
this rich creamy cheesecake.  A dusting of powdered sugar through a
stencil
design makes a nice garnish if you choose not to use the fruit topping.

FOOD PROCESSOR DIRECTIONS: Heat oven to 325 degrees F. Spray 9-inch pie
pan
thoroughly (6 to 8 seconds) with nonstick cooking spray. In small bowl,
combine graham cracker crumbs and sugar; mix well. Add crumb mixture to
pan;
tilt pan to coat evenly. (Avoid tapping pan, which will loosen crumbs from
sides.)  Gently
press crumbs against sides and bottom of pan. (Crumbs will stick loosely
together but will be held firmly in place when filling is added.)  Set
aside.

In food processor bowl with metal blade, process ricotta cheese until
smooth.
* Add 1 cup sugar, cocoa and cream cheese; process until smooth. Add egg
product, milk and vanilla; process until blended. Carefully pour mixture
into crust.

Bake at 325 degrees F. for 45 to 55 minutes or until edges are firm.
(Center
will be soft.)  Turn oven off; let cheesecake stand in oven 30 minutes
with
door open at least 4 inches. Remove from oven; cool to room temperature on
wire rack. Cover; refrigerate at least 2 hours.

To prepare topping, in small saucepan cook orange juice and cornstarch
over
medium heat until mixture thickens and comes to a full boil. Remove from
heat; cool to room temperature. Fold in orange sections, kiwifruit and
strawberries. Serve over cheesecake. Store in refrigerator.

TIP: * Ricotta cheese can be pureed in blender container in 2 batches,
using
half of the milk for each batch.  Transfer pureed ricotta mixture to large
bowl.  Continue as directed using an electric mixer.

Spaghetti Squash Salad (2 PTS)

none

1 large spaghetti squash
3 tablespoons oil
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
1 tablespoon chopped chives
1 large tomato; chopped
  Salt; to taste
  Black pepper; to taste

Cook spaghetti squash: microwave on HIGH for 12 - 15 minutes by piercing
with a fork; or boil it for 30 minutes. Let stand until cool, then cut off
1/3rd lengthwise, leaving remaining 2/3rds to form a boat into which to
put the finished salad. (Before slicing, roll it on its side to determine
best upright position.)

Remove the "spaghetti strands" from both pieces of squash (a spoon usually
helps) and toss in bowl with other ingredients. Replace in shell. Serve at
room temperature or slightly cool. Best made earlier in the day so the
flavors have a chance to mix.

Strawberry Meringue Torte (5.5 PTS)

none

  ***MERINGUE***
6  egg whites
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 dash salt
1 1/2 cups sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
  ***FILLING***
3 cups half and half
1 pkg. instant vanilla pudding mix; (5 1/4 ounce)
1 teaspoon almond extract
  ***TOPPING***
3 cups strawberries; halved
2 tablespoons currant jelly; optional

For a perfect meringue, be sure egg whites are at room temperature and the
bowl and beaters are completely free of fat. Store baked dessert meringues
at room temperature for up to 2 days or freeze them for up to one month.

Heat oven to 275 degrees F. Line 2 cookie sheets with brown or parchment
paper. In large bowl, beat egg whites, cream of tartar and salt until
frothy. Gradually add sugar, beating continuously until stiff peaks form,
about 10 minutes. Beat in vanilla. Spoon half of meringue mixture onto
each
paper-lined sheet. Shape into two 9-inch circles, building up sides
slightly
with back of spoon.

Bake at 275 degrees F. for 1 1/4 hours. Turn oven off; leave meringues in
oven with door closed for 2 hours. Remove from oven; cool completely.
Remove
meringues from paper.

To prepare filling, in medium bowl combine half and half and pudding mix;
beat at low speed 1 minute. Stir in almond extract.

To assemble, place 1 meringue on large serving plate. Spread filling to
edges of meringue; top with remaining meringue. Arrange strawberries over
top. In small saucepan, melt jelly over low heat; brush over berries.
Refrigerate at least 2 hours before serving to soften meringues.

TIP: Meringues can be made 1 or 2 days ahead.  Cover loosely; store at
room
temperature.  Fill and top with berries; refrigerate at least 2 hours
before
serving to soften meringues.

Sunshine Paradise Meringue Pie (4 PTS)

none

  ***MERINGUE***
3  egg whites
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
3/4 cup sugar
  ***FILLING***
2/3 cup sugar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
8 ounces crushed pineapple; drain & reserve
  liquid
2/3 cup orange juice
2  egg yolks; slightly beaten
11 ounces mandarin orange sections; drained
1 medium banana; sliced
1/2 cup macadamia nuts
2 tablespoons coconut

Even before the rotary egg beater was invented in 1870, meringue tarts and
crusts were popular.  For a successful meringue crust, it is important to
gradually beat in the sugar and allow the standing time in the oven after
baking.

Heat oven to 275 degrees F. Line cookie sheet with brown or parchment
paper.
Draw 10-inch circle on paper. In small bowl, beat egg whites, cream of
tartar and cinnamon until foamy. Gradually add 3/4 cup sugar 2 tablespoons
at a time, beating continuously until sugar is dissolved and stiff peaks
form. DO NOT UNDERBEAT. Spread 2/3 of meringue onto 10-inch circle on
paper-lined cookie sheet. Using remaining 1/3 of meringue, spoon or pipe
dollops around edge of circle.

Bake at 275 degrees F. for 30 minutes. Turn oven off; let meringue set in
oven with door closed for 1 hour. Remove from oven; cool completely.
Carefully remove paper from meringue shell; place shell on serving plate.

In medium saucepan, combine 2/3 cup sugar and cornstarch. Stir in reserved
pineapple liquid, orange juice and egg yolks. Cook over medium heat until
mixture boils and thickens, stirring constantly. Boil 1 minute; remove
from
heat. Fold in pineapple, orange segments and banana slices. Spoon into
meringue shell. Cool. Cover with plastic wrap; refrigerate 1 to 2 hours.
To
serve, sprinkle with nuts and coconut; cut into wedges.

TIP: The meringue shell can be made a day ahead.  Cover loosely; store at
room temperature.

Swiss Chard With Bacon And Garlic (2 PTS)

none

2 ounces bacon; chopped
1 pound Swiss chard; coarsely chopped
1 tablespoon fresh garlic; chopped
1/3 cup parmesan cheese; shredded

Selection and storage:  Swiss chard is available spring through early
fall.  Choose chard with crisp stalks and firm, bright green leaves.

Preparation:  Wash Swiss chard thoroughly by dunking it in a sink filled
with water until it is free from any sand.  Young chard can be used in
cooking as-is.  With more mature chard, separate the leaves from the
stems.  Handle the ribs as you would celery, trimming and peeling any
larger ribs nd strings.

1.  In a frying pan, cook bacon until crisp, then drain on paper towels
and pour oil from pan.

2.  Cook chard in the pan until it begins to wilt.  Add garlic and cook,
stirring, for 2 minutes.

3.  Place chard with bacon in a baking dish and sprinkle with Parmesan
cheese.

4.  Bake in a 350º oven until the top is golden brown.

TWICE-BAKED YAMS (4.5 PTS)

none

8  Jewel yams; 6 to 8 ounces each
1  red onion; peeled and minced
1 medium celery root; peeled and chopped
  --fine
2 tablespoons sweet butter
1/2 cup grated pecorino and parmesan (or us
  --cup of either)
1 Pinch nutmeg
  Salt and pepper to taste

1. Wash and dry the yams. Rub with a little salad oil, sprinkle with
salt and bake at 350 degrees for one hour. Cool for 20 minutes. Cut a
1/4-inch lengthwise strip off each yam.

2. Using a small soup spoon, scoop out the yam meat, taking care not
to puncture the skin. Mash the cooked yam in a bowl, placing the yam
skins on a cookie sheet.

3. In a large sauté pan, melt the butter and sauté the onion and
celery root for 3 to 5 minutes over low heat until the vegetables are
tender. Add to the mashed yam and blend with cheeses (reserve some of
the parmesan to top the stuffed yams). Season the mixture with
nutmeg, salt and pepper. Taste.

4. Stuff the yam skins, packing fairly well and top with reserved
parmesan. This part of the preparation may be done a day in advance.
To serve, bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes, or until piping hot.

Choosing the right size and shape yams is the key step for this
recipe, says Josephine Segraves of Mudd's Restaurant. Jewel yams are
best suited; choose ones that are cylindrical.

light and fluffy. Add vanilla and egg; blend well. Lightly spoon flour
into
measuring cup; level off. Stir in flour; mix well. Spread dough into
ungreased 15x10x1-inch baking pan. Sprinkle half of dough with fruit cake
mix and other half with chocolate chips and pecans; press lightly into
dough.

Bake at 350 degrees F. for 25 to 30 minutes or until edges are lightly
browned. Cool completely.

In small bowl, combine powdered sugar and enough milk for desired
drizzling
consistency; blend until smooth. Drizzle over cooled bars. Let stand until
set; cut into bars. Makes 48 bars.

HIGH ALTITUDE - Above 3500 Feet:  Increase flour to 2 1/4 cups. Bake as
directed.

Very Lemon Pie (7.5 PTS)

none

  CRUST:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon butter
3 tablespoons vegetable oil; preferably canola
  FILLING:
3  lemons
2 cups sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 large eggs
3 large egg whites
  confectioner's sugar; for dusting

*To make crust:  Lightly oil a 9-inch pie plate or coat with nonstick
cooking spray.

In a medium-sized bowl, stir together flour, sugar and salt.  In a small
saucepan over low heat, melt butter, swirling it in the pan for about 30
seconds, until light brown.  Pour into a small bowl and let cool.  Stir in
oil.  Using a fork, slowly stir the butter-oil mixture into the flour
until
the mixture is crumbly.  Gradually stir in enough ice water (1 to 2 Tbsp.)
so that the dough will hold together.  Press the dough into a flattened
disk.

Place two 14-inch sheets of plastic wrap overlapping by 2 inches on the
work
surface.  Place pastry in the center and cover with two more overlapping
sheets of plastic wrap.  With a rolling pin, roll the dough into a circle
about 12 inches in diameter.  Remove the top sheets and invert the dough
over the prepared pie plate.  Carefully peel away the remaining plastic
wrap.
Fold the edges under at the rim and crimp.  Chill the pastry while you
prepare the filling.

*To make filling:  Place oven rack in lowest position; preheat oven to
350°.
Grate zest from lemons into a medium-sized saucepan; set aside.  With a
sharp knife, remove the white pith from the lemons and discard.  Working
over the saucepan to catch the juice, cut the lemon segments from their
surrounding membranes, letting them drop into the saucepan.  Squeeze any
remaining juice from the membranes into the saucepan.  Stir in sugar
and salt.  Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring, until sugar
dissolves.  Remove from heat.

In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the eggs and egg whites.  Slowly
whisk the hot lemon-sugar mixture into the eggs.  Pour into the pie
shell and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the filling is set and light

golden on top.

Let cool on rack.  Before serving, dust with confectioners' sugar.

NOTES : Lemon zest, pulp and juice are combined with eggs and sugar in a
wonderful custard.

2 tablespoons cracked wheat cereal
2 tablespoons wheat germ
2 tablespoons honey
1 tablespoon butter or margarine

boiling water for 5 minutes. Decrease the water in the recipe to 5/8
cup.

NOTES : If you were wondering what to spoon onto your baked potato, I
think you'll find this the perfect topping.  This familiar
American sauce is actually a variation on the classic French
rémoulade.  To accentuate the tartness, add the vinegar from the
cornichon.s  The amount of chopped onion is up to you.  This will
keep for a few days in the refrigerator.  Joyce Goldstein

Braised Pork Chops, Dried Cranberries W/Ginger & Oranges

none

2 1/2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon grated orange zest
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
4  boneless loin pork chops; about 5 to 6 ounces
  --each
1 1/2 tablespoons canola or corn oil
1/3 cup chopped onion
1 1/3 cups cranberry juice cocktail
1/2 cup dried sweetened cranberries

In a large shallow bowl, combine the soy sauce, ginger, thyme, orange zest
and pepper. Add the chops, turn to coat and set aside to marinate for 15
minutes.

Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and
cook, stirring frequently, until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer the
chops to the skillet, reserving the marinade. Cook the chops, turning
occasionally, until browned on both sides but not cooked through, about 5
minutes total. Stir in the reserved marinade, 1/3 cup of the cranberry
juice cocktail and the cranberries and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce
the heat to medium-low and simmer just until the pork is cooked through, 9
to 12 minutes. If the liquid completely evaporates, add a little more
cranberry juice cocktail. Transfer the chops to a serving platter; cover to
keep warm. Add the remaining 1 cup cranberry juice cocktail to the
skillet, increase the heat to high and boil until the sauce reduces and
becomes syrupy, about 3 minutes. Be careful not to let it burn. Spoon the
sauce and cranberries over the chops and serve immediately.
