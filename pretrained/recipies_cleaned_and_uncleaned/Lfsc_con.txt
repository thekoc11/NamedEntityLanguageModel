                        ***TOPPERS***

Try these flavor-packed seasonings and you'll forget about butter.

Roasted Garlic & Salt

Separate the cloves of 1 head of garlic, leaving them unpeeled. In a cast-iron skillet over medium heat, toast garlic, stirring often, until soft and blackened in spots, 8 to 10 minutes. Peel and mash garlic with 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt. Spread on hot corn.

Makes about 2 tablespoons, enough for 6 ears of corn.

Garam Masala

Using a spice or coffee grinder, finely grind 1 teaspoon cardamom seeds, 1 teaspoon fennel seeds, 1 teaspoon cumin seeds, 10 cloves, 1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns, 1/2 teaspoon coriander seeds and 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg. Sprinkle on hot corn.

Makes 2 tablespoons, enough for 12 ears of corn. (Store any extra garam masala in a tightly covered jar in a tool dark place.)

Lemon-Garlic Vinaigrette

In a small bowl, whisk 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, 2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil and 1 minced garlic clove. Season with salt to taste. Use a pastry brush to spread on hot corn.

Makes about 2 tablespoons, enough for 4 ears of corn.

Adds 21 calories and 2.3 grams fat per ear.

Flavorful Oils

Choose from extra-virgin olive oil, herb-infused oils or roasted nut or seed oils, such as peanut, pumpkin-seed or sunflower-seed. Use a pastry brush to spread 1/2 teaspoon of oil on each ear of hot corn. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Adds 20 calories and 2.3 grams fat per ear.

Chile & Lime Wedges

Sprinkle pure ground red chile over hot corn, squeeze on lime juice and season with salt and pepper.
