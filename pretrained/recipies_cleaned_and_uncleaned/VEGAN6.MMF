  NOTE: If you cannot find cilantro, use parsley.  Use whatever
  vegetables you like.
  
  A couple of tablespoons of nuts cooked with the vegetables adds some
  creaminess to the soup.

      Title: Jam Cookies
 Categories: Bakery, Cookies, Vegetarian, Mark's
      Yield: 13 cookies
 
    3/4 c  Rolled oats
  1 1/2 c  Wholewheat flour
    1/4 c  Oil
    1/2 c  Maple syrup, or other liquid
           -- sweetener
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      1 ds Almond extract
           Raspberry or other fruit jam
           -- as needed
 
  Place the oats in a blender & grind until you have a flour.  Place in
  a mixing bowl with the remaining ingredients.  Mix well.  If the
  mixture seems too wet, add a little more flour.  You want a dough
  that is stiff enough to hold together when you place it on a cookie
  sheet.
  
  Divide the dough into 13 portions.  Roll each portion in your hands
  into a ball & place on a lightly oiled cookie sheet.  Press down so
  that the cookie dough is flattened & make a thumb imprint in the
  centre of each cookie.  Fill the indentation with jam (raspberry is
  my favourite for this, but any flavour could be used).
  
  Bake in a preheated oven at 350F for 20 minutes or until the cookies
  are cooked through & lightly browned.  Cool on wire racks.

      2 tb Olive oil
      2 tb Flour
      2 c  Soy milk
           Salt & pepper
      1 pn Nutmeg

MMMMM------------------------TO ASSEMBLE-----------------------------
           Lots of lasagna noodles,
           -- preferably green & fresh
  1 1/2 c  Peas, frozen or fresh*
      1 tb Olive oil
           Thyme, as needed
 
  TOMATO SAUCE:  Prepare vegetables as indicated in the ingredient list
  & set aside.  Heat oil in a large pot until hot, & saute the chopped
  & diced vegetables just until the onion has softened.  Add the herbs
  & continue to saute stirring occasionally for a few minutes longer.
  Add the rest of the sauce ingredients & let simmer for 15 minutes,
  stir occasionally.  Set aside, once coked.
  
  BECHAMEL SAUCE:  Heat oil, stir in the flour & cook for about 30
  seconds. Remove from the heat & slowly beat in the milk, ensuring
  that no lumps form.  Return to the heat & cook, stirring over medium
  heat, until the sauce has thickened.  Season with salt, pepper &
  nutmeg.  Set aside.
  
  TO ASSEMBLE:  If using dried pasta, it is advisable to cook it first.
  If using fresh pasta, just sprinkle with a few drops of water before
  baking.
  
  Ladle several spoonfuls of tomato sauce in the bottom of a lasagna pan
  then top with 1/4 of pasta, let the sheets rise up the sides of the
  pan. Top with half the bechamel sauce & half the peas.  Add another
  layer of pasta, another layer of tomato sauce & top with a third
  layer of pasta. Add the remaining bechamel sauce & peas.  Top with
  the rest of the tomato sauce.  Drizzle with olive oil & sprinkle with
  thyme.
  
  Bake in a pre-heated oven at 400F for 40 minutes, until bubbling hot.
  Serve with home-made garlic bread & a green salad.
  
  * If using fresh peas, blanch before adding them to the lasagna
  layers.

      Title: Squash Samosas
 Categories: Appetizers, Indian, Vegetables, Mark's
      Yield: 24 samosas
 
MMMMM---------------------------PASTRY--------------------------------
    1/2 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Wholewheat flour
      2 ea Jalapeno chiles, seeded &
           -- coarsely chopped
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Oil
           Water, as necessary

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
  2 1/2 c  Winter squash, cooked &
           -- pureed
      2 ts Oil
    1/2 ts Nutmeg
    1/2 ts White pepper
      2 ea Jalapeno chiles, minced
           Salt, to taste
    1/3 c  Coconut, shredded
 
  PASTRY:  Combine all dry ingredients in a bowl.  Add oil & slowly
  drizzle in water until the dough forms a ball.  Knead until very soft
  & pliable. Wrap in a damp towel & let rest for 2 hours or so.
  
  FILLING:  Heat oil in a skillet, add the pureed squash & saute,
  stirring frequently, for 15 minutes.  Stir in the remaining
  ingredients.  REmove from heat & let cool.
  
  TO ASSEMBLE:  Divide dough into 12 equal balls.  Roll each ball into a
  circle, very thinly, & slice in half.  Keep covered with a damp towel
  until ready to use, otherwise the pastry will dry out too much & you
  will not be able to use it.  Place a portion of filling on one half
  of the semi-circle.  Dampen the edges with some water & seal.  Set
  each samosa aside until ready to cook.
  
  TO COOK:  Either, preheat the oven to 350F, place samosas on an
  ungreased cookie sheet & bake for 20 minutes.  Or, deep-fry for 7
  minutes or until browned.  Drain on paper towels & serve immediately
  with good chutnies.  Or let go cold & freeze.  Reheat in a 350F oven.
  
  NOTE:  Baked samosas have a harder & more crunchy pastry.  Deep-fried
  & I find that they retain too much fat.  Try whichever way you find
  you prefer.

      Title: Macaroni Salad
 Categories: Salads, Pasta, Side dish, Vegetarian, Mark's
      Yield: 1 recipe
 
MMMMM---------------------SALAD INGREDIENTS--------------------------
      2 c  Elbow macaroni
    1/2 c  Green bell pepper, diced
      1 ea Green onion, sliced
    1/2 c  Green peas, blanched
      1 tb Dijon
    1/2 ts Basil
      1 tb Parsley
    1/2 ts Marjoram
      2 ea Garlic cloves, minced
      1 ds Tabasco
           Salt & pepper

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
    1/4 c  Cashews
      1 c  Soy milk
  1 1/2 tb Cornstarch
      1 tb Lemon juice
 
  SALAD: Cook macaroni until al dente.  Drain & run under cold water to
  stop it cooking.  If you prefer a softer pasta, cook it for longer.
  
  In a large bowl, combine the cooked pasta with the vegetables, herbs &
  spices.  Mix well & set aside.
  
  SAUCE: In a blender or food processor, grind the cashews until they
  are a powder, but be careful not to over-process otherwise you will
  end up with a nut butter.  Add the remaining sauce ingredients &
  blend to combine.
  
  Pour as much of the sauce as you require over the macaroni &
  vegetables & mix.  Chill well before serving.
  
  NOTE: I think that you might get a thicker sauce if you wanted by
  cooking the sauce ingredients first.  Heat a touch of olive oil, add
  some cornstarch & slowly beat in soy milk.  Then follow the procedure
  as above. Alternatively, add 1/4 c of tofu after you have ground the
  nuts.
  
  Any unused sauce will keep in the refrigerator.

  Asian markets. If necessary, use wonton skins.
  
  In skillet, heat vegetable oil over medium heat.  Add red pepper,
  green onion, mushrooms and gingerroot; cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Add
  cabbage, carrot, soy sauce and sesame oil; cook, stirring
  occasionally, 3 minutes. Remove from heat and cool slightly.
  
  Working one at a time to prevent Gyoza skins from drying out, place a
  heaping teaspoon of vegetable mixture in center of each round.
  Moisten edge of round with water and fold in half to enclose filling.
  Pinch edges to seal completely.  Set filled dumplings on a plate and
  cover with plastic wrap.
  
  To make fried dumplings, heat 1" vegetable oil over medium-high heat
  in 2-quart saucepan.  In batches, fry dumplings, turning, until
  browned on both sides - about 2 minutes.  Drain on paper towels and
  serve.
  
  To cook dumplings in broth, in 2-quart saucepan heat bouillon mixture
  to simmering.  In batches, cook dumplings in simmering broth 3
  minutes. Remove with slotted spoon, dividing among 4 serving bowls or
  deep plates. When all dumplings are cooked, spoon 2 tb. remaining
  broth over each serving. Garnish with cilantro, if desired, and serve.

      Title: South Indian Dosas
 Categories: Bakery, Indian, Breakfast, Snacks, Vegetarian
      Yield: 8 pancakes
 
    1/2 c  Urad dal
      1 c  Long-grain rice
    3/4 ts Salt
    3/4 ts Ground cumin seeds
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil (about)
 
  Pick over and wash urad dal.  Soak in 2 cups water for 8 hours.
  
  Wash rice and soak in 3 cups water for 8 hours.
  
  Drain dal; blend in food processor or blender for 2 minutes, scraping
  down sides occasionally.  Add 2 tablespoons water and process another
  minute. Add another 2 tablespoons water and process again for one
  minute. Continue adding water until you've reached 3/4 cup total, and
  mixture is light and fluffy.  Place in a bowl and set aside.
  
  Drain rice; blend in food processor or blender, adding 3/4 of water 2
  tablespoons at a time, until mixture resembles fine grains of
  semolina. Combine rice mixture with dal mixture.  Cover and leave in
  a warm place to ferment, 16-20 hours.
  
  The fermented batter should be frothy.  Add the salt and cumin and
  stir to combine.
  
  Have all cooking paraphernalia ready and at hand.  You will need to
  have near your skillet: 1/4 to 1/2 cup of vegetable oil in a cup or
  bowl with a small spoon, a larger spoon to spread the batter, the
  bowl of batter with a 1/2-cup measuring scoop/cup, a metal spatula
  for turning the pancakes, and a plate on which to place the finished
  dosas after they are cooked.
  
  Pour 1 teaspoon of oil into the skillet and tilt to distribute
  evenly. Heat the skillet over medium-low until oil is hot. Pour 1/2
  cup of the mixture onto the center of the hot skillet. Use the large
  spoon to spread the batter in a spiral motion, until the pancake is
  about 6-7 inches in diameter.  Turn pancake after 2 minutes and cook
  another 2 minutes on the other side, until lightly browned. Remove
  pancake to plate and repeat with remaining batter, adding only enough
  additional oil to the skillet as needed to keep surface evenly
  greased.  I found that about 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon for each pancake was
  plenty, but your mileage may vary.
  
  Serve with relishes, pickles, chutney, or cooked vegetables.

      Title: Chayote & Corn Stuffed Chilies with Red Sauce
 Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian, Karen's
      Yield: 10 chiles
 
     10 lg Fresh long green chilies

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      1 tb Vegetable oil
      2 ea Garlic cloves, minced
    1/2 ea Onion, finely diced
      1 lg Chayote squash
           -- seeded, finely diced
      1 c  Corn kernels
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Ground red chili pepper
           Black pepper, to taste
      2 tb Lemon juice
    1/2 c  Coarse breadcrumbs
      1 tb Nutritional yeast (optional)

MMMMM---------------------------BATTER--------------------------------
      1 c  Cornmeal
    2/3 c  All-purpose flour
      1 ts Baking powder
    3/4 ts Salt
  1 1/4 c  Water
           Vegetable oil, for frying

MMMMM-------------------------RED SAUCE------------------------------
      1 c  Tomato sauce
      2 ea Garlic cloves
    1/2 ea Onion
  1 1/2 c  Water
      1 tb Ground red chili pepper
    1/2 ts Salt (or to taste)
    1/4 ts Cinnamon
    1/4 ts Ground cumin
 
  Roast chile peppers according to your favorite method.  (I don't have
  a gas stove or other type of open flame, so I heat the oven to the
  hottest temperature, then bake the peppers on a heavy-duty baking
  sheet, turning if necessary to char all sides.  The roasted peppers
  are placed in a bowl, covered, then allowed to steam a few minutes to
  help facilitate removal of the peels.)
  
  Carefully remove peels from roasted peppers, leaving stems attached.
  Remove seeds by cutting a slit along one side of each pepper and
  gently scraping and rinsing out seeds and attached membranes.  Pat
  dry and set aside.
  
  FILLING: In a heavy skillet, heat oil on medium-high.  Add garlic,
  onion and chayote; cook until onion is translucent and mixture begins
  to brown, stirring frequently.  Remove pan from heat and add corn,
  chili pepper, salt, black pepper, and lemon juice, stirring to
  combine well. Gently mix in breadcrumbs and nutritional yeast.
  
  On a flat surface, open up one pepper at a time and spread about 3
  tablespoons of the filling mixture down the center of each.
  Carefully roll sides of pepper around filling to enclose, pressing
  firmly to shape. (Chiles may be prepared ahead of time to this point,
  covered, and refrigerated up to 24 hours.)
  
  BATTER: In a pie plate or shallow dish, stir together cornmeal, flour,
  baking powder and salt.  Gradually mix in water to form a batter of
  medium consistency.
  
  Heat 1-1/2 inches of oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
  Lightly roll each stuffed chili pepper in flour.  Carefully coat each
  pepper with batter, as evenly as possible, using stem to help drag
  chili through mixture, and a spoon to spread batter over top of chili
  if necessary. Fry chilies in hot oil, two at a time, until lightly
  browned, turning once. It should take about 3 to 4 minutes per side.
  Remove and drain on absorbent paper.  (The temperature and freshness
  of the oil is important. If conditions are right, each chili will
  absorb LESS than 1 tablespoon of oil.)
  
  (If chiles must be prepared in advance, reheat just before serving by
  placing them on a baking sheet in a preheated 350 F. oven until hot
  and crisp.)
  
  RED SAUCE: In a food processor or blender, puree garlic and onion with
  tomato sauce. Transfer to a saucepan and add water, ground red chili
  pepper, salt, cinnamon and cumin. Cook sauce over medium heat for 30
  minutes, stirring frequently to prevent scorching.
  
  TO SERVE: Spoon a little sauce onto each plate, spreading it around
  in a spiral fashion with the back of the spoon to form a large
  circle. Place a chili onto circle of sauce, drizzling a bit of
  additional sauce over top if desired, and garnish with a few slices
  of avocado and/or some finely minced cilantro leaves.  A black bean
  salad and slices of cooling fresh melon and/or tropical fruits would
  be nice accompaniments.

      Title: French Dressing
 Categories: Salads, Dressings, Sauces
      Yield: 1 recipe
 
    1/2 c  Oil
           Little scraped onion
    1/4 ts Mustard
    1/2 ts Paprika
    1/2 ts Salt
           Little pepper
      1 ts Sugar
      2 dr Worcestershire sauce
      2 tb Lemon juice
 
  Mix all ingredients together and beat well. or you can out into a
  covered jar and shake hard until blended. Keep in a cold place. A
  milder dressing may be made by omitting the onion, mustard and
  Worcestershire sauce. The seasonings are a matter of personal
  preference. Instead of lemon juice, you may wish to use cider
  vinegar; or for a pleasant change, tarragon vinegar. Always serve
  French dressing cold.
  
  Many of the recipes in this collection did not contain amounts or oven
  temperatures. I have typed them in as they appear in the book, typos

      Title: Chocolate-Cinnamon Torte with Mocha Fudge Glaze
 Categories: Bakery, Cakes, Desserts, Vegetarian
      Yield: 16 servings
 
MMMMM----------------------------CAKE---------------------------------
      8 oz Tofu
      2 c  Granular sweetener
           -- (such as Sucanat)
    3/4 c  Oil
      1 c  Water
      1 tb Vanilla extract
      2 c  All-purpose flour
    3/4 c  Cocoa powder
      2 ts Ground cinnamon
      1 ts Baking soda
      1 ts Cream of tartar

MMMMM---------------------MOCHA FUDGE GLAZE--------------------------
    1/4 c  Margarine or oil
    1/4 c  Cocoa powder
      3 tb Water
      1 ts Instant espresso powder
  1 1/2 c  Granular sweetener
      1 ts Vanilla extract
           Ground cinnamon for garnish
 
  For CAKE: Preheat oven to 350 F.  Oil a 10- or 12-inch springform
  pan; dust lightly with a bit of cocoa powder.
  
  Using electric mixer, blend tofu with sweetener on low speed until
  mixture is paste-like.  Increase speed and beat until tofu is
  thoroughly blended and mixture is shiny and the consistency of thick
  syrup. (Don't worry about undissolved granules of sweetener which may
  remain; they will dissolve later on when the liquids are added.)
  
  Add oil, water and vanilla to tofu mixture, beating until thoroughly
  combined.  Sift together flour, cinnamon, baking soda, cream of
  tartar, and cocoa powder. Blend sifted dry ingredients into liquid
  mixture. Pour batter into prepared pan and bake until tester inserted
  in center comes out clean, about 40-50 minutes.  Transfer to rack and
  cool completely.
  
  GLAZE: In a small saucepan, combine all ingredients. Cook and stir
  over medium heat until mixture is shiny and completely smooth.  Let
  mixture come to a boil, then immediately remove from heat.  Let cool
  10 minutes. Stir vigorously before using.
  
  To assemble cake:  Remove sides from pan.  If necessary, slice off
  top of cake to make surface even, then invert cake on rack set over a
  pan to catch drips of excess glaze.  Remove pan bottom from cake.
  Pour glaze evenly over top of cake, allowing some to drip down sides
  also. Use a knife or spatula to spread glaze around sides.  Transfer
  to serving platter. Decorate by sprinkling additional ground cinnamon
  over cake, using stencils to create shapes or a pattern if desired.
  
  Variation: A mixture of chopped toasted nuts and ground cinnamon may
  be pressed onto sides of freshly glazed cake instead of sprinkling
  plain cinnamon over top.

      Title: Samosas with Spicy Pumpkin Filling
 Categories: Bakery, Indian, Vegetarian, Karen's
      Yield: 1 batch
 
MMMMM------------------------SAMOSA DOUGH-----------------------------
  1 1/2 c  Flour
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Oil
      5 tb Cold water
           -- or as needed

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      1 tb Oil
    1/2 md Onion
      2 ea Garlic cloves
     16 oz Cooked pumpkin puree
           -- canned or homemade
      1 tb Lemon juice
    1/2 ts Salt, or to taste
    1/2 ts Cayenne pepper, or to taste
    1/4 ts Ground cumin
    1/4 ts Ground coriander
    1/8 ts Turmeric
    1/8 ts Ground ginger
    1/8 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/8 ts Ground cardamom
    1/4 ts Sugar
           Oil, for frying
 
  In a food processor or by hand, combine flour and salt.  Add oil,
  mixing until flour resembles fine crumbs.  Add just enough cold water
  to form a medium-soft dough.  (If using a food processor, dough will
  form a ball and leave sides of work bowl.)  Refrigerate dough,
  covered, while you prepare filling.
  
  In a skillet, saute onion and garlic in 1 tablespoon oil.  When onion
  and garlic are soft and translucent, add pumpkin and seasonings. Cook
  over medium heat, stirring frequently, until mixture it thick, about
  10 minutes. Set aside to cool before filling samosas.
  
  Assembly:  Roll out small 1-inch balls of dough into very thin
  circles. Cut each circle in half.  Place a rounded teaspoonful of
  filling into the middle of one semi-circle, then roll dough up to
  encase filling, forming a cone-shape in which the circle's rounded
  edge becomes the wide end of the cone.  Pinch wide end of cone
  closed. Repeat for remaining dough and filling until all samosas are
  filled.
  
  Heat a couple of inches of oil over moderately-low heat.  Fry samosas
  in hot oil until golden brown and crisp.  Remove and drain on
  absorbent paper.

  rising, saute 1 medium onion in 1 tablespoon olive oil until
  transparent. Lightly smash 1 cup of Greek black olives with a wooden
  mallet or knife handle to split; remove pits from olives.  Mix olives
  and onions together and let cool.
  
  After punching down dough, turn onto a floured surface and roll out
  to form a rectangle about 1/2 inch thick.  Cover rectangle with onion
  and olive mixture, leaving a border around edges.  Starting at one
  long end, roll up dough and shape into a loaf.  Press edges closed.
  
  Place loaf on a greased baking sheet and slash diagonally in three or
  four places.  Cover and let rise again until double in size.  Bake in

      Title: Mark's Version of Falafels
 Categories: Appetizers, Middle east, Snacks, Lunch, Mark's
      Yield: 1 recipe
 
      2 c  Chick peas
      4 ea Garlic cloves, minced
      1 sm Onion, minced
      1 tb Coriander
  1 1/2 tb Cumin
           Several dashes tabasco
      3 tb Wholewheat flour
           Salt & pepper
    1/4 c  Parsley, minced
           Stock, as needed
 
  Soak chick peas, rinse well, cover with fresh water, bring to a boil &
  simmer until very tender.  Depending on how fresh the chick peas are
  will determine how long this will take.  Give them about 1 1/2 hours.
  Drain well & set aside to cool.
  
  When cool, place chick peas in food processor bowl & blend until very
  smooth.  If you have a large enough bowl, add the rest of the
  ingredients, except the stock, & mix in the blender.  If the bowl is
  not large enough, you will have to do this in batches.  Then add the
  ingredients in order, mixing well after each addition.  Add a little
  stock if the mixture appears too dry or looks as if it is not going
  to hold together very well. Cover & set aside for 30 minutes.
  
  Shape into patties.  If the patties do not hold together very well,
  you may want to add a little more flour, but be careful, you do not
  want to make them too floury.  Place on a lightly oiled baking sheet
  & gently flatten.  This amount should make 15 to 18 patties, so make
  them a reasonable size.  Preheat the oven to 350F.  Bake the falafel
  patties for 5 minutes, remove trays, flip the patties & return to the
  oven for another 5 minutes.  Remove from trays & cool on wire racks.
  
  To serve: Heat some olive oil in a good heavy skillet, you can
  choose: I use 2 tb of olive oil, or you could deep fry them in a wok.
  If using the wok method, crumble one dried red chile into the oil as
  it is heating. When the oil is hot, fry the falafel patties until
  golden.  Flip & fry the other side.  Remove from the oil, drain &
  serve.
  
  Either serve the falafel as part of a Middle Eastern platter including
  some baba ganouj, hummus, tabouleh, lettuce, tomatoes, green onions &
  pita.  Or, make up a sauce using tahini & hot sauce, warm a pita
  bread, slice the top off, spread the tahini paste in the pita, drop
  in two patties, cover with lettuce, tomatoes & green onions.  Either
  a great snack or a main meal.

      Title: Tomato-Basil Soup
 Categories: Appetizers, Soups, Vegetables, Mark's
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 lb Tomatoes, diced
      2 ea Garlic cloves, coarsely
           -- chopped
      2 tb Olive oil
    1/4 c  Dry red wine
      5 c  Vegetable stock
      1 cn Tomato paste, optional
      2 bn Basil, coarsely chopped
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
 
  The tomatoes need to be diced into bite-sized pieces.  Set aside.
  
  Heat olive oil until it is warmed.  Add the garlic & saute it very
  gently only until it becomes fragrant.  Add the tomatoes, stir once &
  add the remaining ingredients except the basil & salt & pepper.
  Raise the heat a little, cover & let the soup cook gently without
  ever letting it quite come to the boil.  Let it cook like this for 45
  minutes.  You want the tomatoes to be softened.  Add the seasonings &
  the basil.  Cook long enough to warm the basil through.  Serve with
  freshly baked, crusty, Italian bread.
  
  MARK'S NOTE: If you want a thin soup, omit the tomato paste.  If you
  want it to be thicker, add the paste, but it will make quite a
  difference to the texture of the soup.  If serving as a lunch, or
  with only a light main course, then the paste makes this a rich &
  satisfying soup: if serving purely as an appetizer, then omit the
  tomato paste.
  
  Also, do not let the soup come to a full rolling boil.  It is best
  served warmed.  Once you add the basil, you may want to switch the
  heat off & let the soup sit for a while, reheating just before
  serving.

      Title: Roasted Rosemary Potatoes
 Categories: Side dish, Vegetables
      Yield: 8 servings
 
  2 1/2 lb Small red potatoes
           Olive oil
           Seasoning salt
           Dried rosemary leaves
 
  This a method more so than a recipe.  For those who require
  quantities, I recommend about 1/4 cup oil, about 2 tsp seasoning
  salt, and about 2 TBS dried rosemary leaves. Cut potatoes into
  quarters, about bite-size pieces. Do not peel.  In a large bowl, toss
  potatoes in oil to coat. There shouldn't be a lot of oil left in the
  bowl. Sprinkle with seasoning salt and rosemary leaves, then turn a
  couple of times to coat. Cover a large baking sheet with aluminum
  foil and spray LIGHTLY with cooking spray. Place potatoes on a single
  layer on the sheet. Roast in a pre-heated 400 degree oven for 45 to
  55 minutes, until golden brown and slightly puffed. You may turn
  potatoes once, after 25 minutes, if you wish. Serve ASAP from oven.
  If desired you may adjust seasoning (more salt) before serving.

      Title: Devilled Corn
 Categories: Appetizers, Vegetables, Mark's
      Yield: 1 recipes
 
           Corn, as necessary

MMMMM------------------------BASTING OIL-----------------------------
    1/4 c  Olive oil
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil
      1 tb Sweet Hungarian paprika
      1 pn Cayenne
      1 ts Whole cumin seeds, lightly
           -- crushed in a mortar &
           -- pestle
           Salt & pepper, as necessary
 
  Use only unhusked corn.  Soak in water for at least 30 minutes.
  Prepare either a grill or preheat an oven to 375F.
  
  While the corn is soaking, whisk together all the basting ingredients.
  When the corn has soaked for 30 minutes, carefully peel back the
  husks & remove the silk.  Do not remove the husks entirely.  Using a
  pastry brush, brush the oil over the corn.  Close up the husks & tie
  them closed.  You need to ensure that the corn is well wrapped
  otherwise it will dry out as it grills.
  
  Place on grill & grill for 15 minutes, turning frequently.  If you do
  not turn the corn, it will burn.  Or, bake in the middle of the
  preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes.  Remove husks & serve
  immediately.  Or let cool & refrigerate & serve as part of a salad
  buffet.

      Title: Leesa's Inspired Cold Potato Salad
 Categories: Side dish, Salads, Vegetables, Mark's
      Yield: 1 recipe
 
      1 lb Small new potatoes, unpeeled
      1 ea Lime, halved
           Salt & pepper
           Ground serrano chile
           Jalapeno chiles, sliced
 
  Place the potatoes in a pot of water & bring to a boil.  If the
  potatoes are quite small, leave whole, if larger you may need to
  halve or quarter them, but do not make them too small.  Simmer
  potatoes until they are cooked through, but do not overcook them.
  Remove from heat, drain & plunge into cold water to stop them
  cooking.  Chil lightly in the refrigerator.
  
  When ready to serve, slice the potatoes fairly thickly.  Sprinkle with
  salt & pepper & generously spray with the juice of 1/2 a lime, use a
  whole lime if they are small.  Sprinkle with serrano chile powder
  (this is available from Mexican or Spanish style supermarkets &
  imparts a more smoky flavour than ground red chiles) & garnish with
  jalapenoes.  Serve as part of a salad buffet.
  
  This is an excellent dish to take on a picnic.  Prepare it at the
  picnic, just cook the potatoes before you go & serve as part of a
  salad.

MMMMM-------------------------SPICE MIX------------------------------
      3 tb Olive oil
      3 tb Vegetable oil

  drain them & plunge immediately into the prepared spice mix.  Toss
  gently & remove to a prepared grill.  Kebob baskets are very helpful
  here.  Grill over hot coals until the chips are done to their desired
  consistency.  Any left over spice mix can be used to baste as the

  cooking, add the chopped zucchini.  Remove from heat & drain.  Let
  cool slightly.
  
  While the pasta is cooking.  Whisk together the oil, wine vinegar,
  salt, pepper & garlic.  Turn into a bowl & toss in the rosemary &
  tomato.  When the pasta & zucchini have cooked, toss with the
  marinade.  Let cool to room temperature & then lightly chill before

  more flour as necessary until the dough is no longer sticky.  Divide
  into quarters & turn onto a floured surface.
  
  Roll each quarter into a cylinder no more than 2" in diameter & cut
  into 1" slices.  With a floured fork & thumb, make an indentation in
  the centre of each slice & with a gentle rolling motion flip over to
  form gnocchi. Set aside & repeat until all dough has been prepared in
  this way.
  
  Fill a very large pot with salted water & bring to a full rolling
  boil. Place gnocchi in the water, lower to a simmer & stir gently
  occasionally. The gnocchi will rise to the surface when it is done.
  When this happens, simmer for 8 minutes.  Remove with a slotted spoon
  & place in a casserole. Preheat oven to 350F.

  Put the stock in a large saucepan (you can use any stock, except
  pork). Season with salt and pepper and bring to the boil. Add the
  chopped or crumbled leaves and simmer for 10 minutes if the leaves
  are fresh and for 30 minutes if dry.
  
  Meanwhile, prepare the "Taklia" or garlic sauce. Melt the butter in a
  small frying-pan. Add the garlic and fry, stirring, until it is
  golden brown. Add the coriander and cayenne and cook, stirring, for 2
  minutes. Add the garlic mixture to the soup, cover the pan, and
  simmer for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Adjust the seasoning and
  serve.
  
  * "Melokhia is a soup made from an Egyptian herb similar to spinach.
  It is one of the national dishes of Egypt. Melokhia leaves are
  available dried from Greek shops, and occasionally the fresh leaves
  are available in some markets." If you can't get Melokhia, try this
  recipe with spinach. Works for me!

      Yield: 20 samosas
 
      1 c  Split peas, washed
      1 ts Turmeric
           Salt
      2 tb Cilantro, chopped

MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
  1 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
      1 pn Salt
      1 tb Oil
    1/2 c  Water, approximately

MMMMM---------------------------SPICES--------------------------------
      1 ts Oil
      1 sm Onion, finely chopped
    1/8 ts Asafetida
    1/2 ts Black mustard seeds
      1 ts Whole cumin seeds
      3 ea Dried red chiles, crumbled
           Salt

MMMMM----------------------FOR DEEP FRYING---------------------------
           Oil
 
  Cover the washed split peas with 2 cups water.  Add the turmeric & the
  salt.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover & simmer.  Simmer until the
  split peas just start to break up, about 35 to 45 minutes.  Do not
  overcook.  Drain carefully.  Transfer to a mixing bowl & stir in the
  cilantro.  Set aside.
  
  DOUGH: Combine the flour, salt & oil.  Pour in enough water until the
  flour congeals into a ball.  Knead vigorously for 10 minutes until the
  dough is soft & pliable.  Wrap in a damp towel & let rest for at
  least 30 minutes.
  
  SPICES: Heat oil in a skillet, saute the onions until golden brown.
  Add the asafetida & a few seconds later the rest of the spices in the
  order listed.  Saute, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes.  Pour
  into the prepared split pea mixture & let cool.
  
  ASSEMBLY & COOKING: Divide the dough into 10 balls.  Roll each ball
  out very thinly into a circle, but not so thinly that it will rip
  when you pick it up.  Cut each resultant disk in half.  Set each half
  aside, preferably covered with the damp towel to prevent drying.  Do
  all the balls of dough in this way.
  
  Take one halved disk, heap one tablespoon of split filling onto one
  half of the disk.  Lightly dampen the edges of the dough with water &
  seal into a triangular shape.  Repeat until all disks have been
  fileld & sealed in this way.
  
  Heat oil in a wok, enough to deep fry about 4 samosas at once.  When
  the oil is hot, carefully drop 4 samosas into the wok.  Fry for 3 to
  4 minutes & flip over.  The pastry should be a deep golden brown.
  When cooked, remove with a slotted spoon & drain well.
  
  Either serve immediately or let cool & freeze.  Reheat in an oven
  preheated to 300F for 10 minutes or so.  Be careful as they will burn
  very easily.

      Yield: 20 burgers
 
      2 c  Pinto beans, soaked
      4 ea Dried red chiles
      4 ea Garlic cloves, halved
      4 c  Water
    1/2 ts Sage

    1/2 ts Hungarian paprika
           Salt & pepper
           Flour, as needed
           Oil, for brushing
 
  Rinse soaked beans.  Cover with water, add the chiles & garlic cloves,
  bring to a boil & simmer for 1 hour or until very soft.  When cooked,
  drain well & mash with a potato masher (Note: I have tried running
  these through a processor, but their consistency is much softer).  Do
  not remove the chiles or garlic unless you really do not want the
  extra taste. Preheat the oven to 350F.
  
  Add the remaining ingredients & mix very well.  Add enough flour to
  ensure that the patties will hold together.  Divide mixture into 20
  equal portions & shape into a ball.  Flatten each ball into a pattie
  & place on a lightly oiled cookie sheet.  Brush each pattie with a
  little vegetable oil & bake for 10 minutes.  Flip the patties, brush
  with oil & bake for another 10 minutes.  The baking helps them hold
  together better.  Cool on wire racks.
  
  To serve, fry or grill as you would any burger & serve with all the
  fixings.  They also freeze reasonably well.

      1 ts Ginger, minced
      3 tb Sesame oil
      2 tb Rice vinegar
      1 tb Lime juice

  In a large bowl, combine corn, beans, celery, onion, pepper, cilantro,
  chiles, garlic & ginger.  Set aside.
  
  In another bowl, whisk together oil, vinegar & lime juice.  Pour over
  the ingredients in the large bowl & mix well.  Season with salt &
  chill until ready to serve.
  
  MARK'S NOTE: I am not sure what makes this "Thai", however the taste
  is not bad.  I especially like using black beans in contrast with
  other bright colours.  I used galangal in place of ginger in this
  recipe plus a pinch of lemongrass.  I replaced the red onion with a
  couple of large green onions, chopped.
  
  Next time, I'll use red chiles rather than jalapeno chiles.
  Jalapenoes, especially when seeded, do not have much taste.  A couple
  of red chiles, finely minced should go a long way towards perking up
  an otherwise promising dish.  Oh yes, do increase the lime juice.  I
  used as much juice as I could squeeze out of half a large lime & it
  could have still used more, so 1 tb is not nearly enough.  Try
  garnishing with kaffir lime leaves as well.

  MARK'S NOTE:  An easy way to grill corn.  Soak the unhusked corn in
  water for 20 minutes.  If using a grill, place the ears in the coals
  right at the edge of your barbecue.  Turn very often.  They should be
  done after 20 minutes, maybe a little less.  Or, bake in a 350F oven
  for the same length of time.  This is my favourite way to cook corn,
  it doesn't taste waterlogged using this method.

      Title: Deep fried Zucchini
 Categories: Side dish, Italian, Vegetables
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    250 g  Zucchini (small ones)
    150 ml Soy milk
     50 g  Flour
           Salt & pepper, to taste
           Oil for deep frying
 
  Note. The zucchini should be reasonably small no longer than 6" (15
  cm).
  
  Trim the ends from the zucchini and cut them in half across (to give
  two pieces around 3" long). Then cut each half into lengthwise slices
  around 1/4" (6mm).
  
  Season the flour generously with salt and pepper, and start heating
  the oil. Dip the zucchini pieces into the milk, then into the
  seasoned flour, shaking off any excess flour. As soon as you have
  enough to make a batch, deep fry them in hot oil intol golden. Drain,
  and serve as soon as possible. These zucchini do _not_ keep at all.

  Roast & peel jalapeno chiles, seed, dice & set aside.
  
  Heat olive oil & saute the onion over medium-high heat until
  caramelized. Transfer to a blender along with the chiles (not the
  jalapeno chiles), garlic, tomatoes, beer & puree.
  
  In a wok or large skillet, heat peanut oil until smoking hot & add the
  puree.  Re-fry until reduced & thickened, this will take about 5
  minutes. Transfer 3/4 of this re-fried mixture to a mixing bowl & add
  beans & cider vinegar.  Garnish with jalapeno.

  gathers on the surface.  Cover & simmer for 20 to 30 minutes, or until
  tender.  (Mark's note: the recipe doesn't say, but I presume that it
  is calling for split moong beans: whole ones take a whole lot longer
  to cook than this).
  
  Heat ghee in a large pot & add cumin seeds, bay leaves, chiles,
  onions & ginger.  Fry for 2 minutes, stirring.  Add raisins & coconut
  & mix in the cooked dal.  Add the remaining ingredients & simmer over
  low heat, uncovered, for 15 to 20 minutes.  If the resultant dal is
  too thick, thin it with a little water.  It should be conssitency of
  pea soup.

      1 lb Onions
      1 lb Rutabagas
      1 lb Potatoes
      1 lb Carrots
      1 lb Parsnips
      1 c  Vegetable oil
    1/3 c  Lemon pepper
      2 tb Salt, or to taste
 
  Peel and cut onions in large wedges. Peel and cut rutabagas into
  thumb-size chunks. Scrub and cut potatoes into thumb-size chunks.
  Peel and cut both carrots and parsnips into 1/2"-thick diagonal
  chunks.
  
  In a large bowl toss cut veggies with lemon pepper and salt.  If
  you're using a lemon pepper blend with the salt in it, omit the extra
  salt.
  
  Spread on baking sheets in single layer.  It helps to line the baking
  sheets with parchment paper.
  
  Roast at 425 degrees for 35 to 50 minutes, till golden brown and
  tender. Serve hot.
  
  Rutabagas are members of the turnip family and are frequently
  referred to as yellow turnips.  Parsnips are sometimes referred to as
  white carrots, but they are not carrots.  Both are vegetables
  commonly found in American markets in the fall.  You can use this
  method with most any firm vegetable that normally takes a few minutes
  to boil/steam cook: green beans work very well here, as do various
  other root vegetables.

  they will be done before the potatoes. The vegetables should be
  cooked but firm. Grind ginger and garlic. If fresh ginger is not
  available, use 1/2 tsp ginger powder. Finely chop the cilantro, green
  onion and jalapeno. Mix slice onion with basil, binegar and olive
  oil. Marinate 10-15 minutes. In a small wok on medium heat, add 1 tb
  canola oil. When hot, add the cumin seeds. Fry until light brown. Add
  the onions. Cook until opaque. Add ginger and garlic. Saut for a few
  minutes. Add the potatoes, cauliflower and the diced tomato. If the
  vegetables stick to the pan, add a little water to keep it moist.
  Simmer until vegetables are done. Sprinkle with chopped cilantro,
  lemon juice and sliced tomato before serving.

      Title: Ratatouille
 Categories: Side dish, French, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    1/2 lb Egplant
    1/2 lb Zucchini
      1 ts Salt
      3 tb Olive oil
    1/2 lb Onions, thinly sliced
      2 ea Green peppers, sliced
      2 ea Cloves garlic, mashed
      3 tb Olive oil
           Salt & pepper to taste
      1 lb Ripe tomatoes
           Salt & pepper
      3 tb Parsley
 
  NB. This ratatouille recipe is the only one I know in which the
  vegetables all retain their own identity and don't end up in a
  more-or-less anonymous mush. The disadvantage is that it is a lot of
  trouble to prepare. Try it none-the-less in the early autumn, when
  the ingredients are all reasonable in price and at their best. Don't
  bother with watery orange tomatoes and glasshouse grown peppers &
  aubergines.
  
  Peel the eggplants and wipe the zucchinis. Remove the ends then cut
  into 3/8" (1cm) thick slices. The slices should be taken engthwise
  and end up about 1" by 3" (2.5 x 8 cms). Place the vegetables in a
  bowl and toss with the salt - you can use a little more if you feel
  like it. Turn into a colander and layer evenly placing a weighted
  plate on top. Leave 30 minutes to drain.
  
  Peel the tomatoes and halve them across. Squeeze each half to push
  out the pips, and then put them cut side up in a rack or colander.
  Sprinkle with salt and then turn over. Sprinkle again and leave for
  about half an hour. Slice them into 1/2" (1cm) strips, removing the
  stems if tough. Leave aside until ready to use.
  
  Peel and slice the onion thinly, core the green peppers and slice
  them, crush the garlic. Chop the parsley.
  
  Put the olive oil in a large frying pan. While it is heating, dry the
  eggplants and zucchinis carefully with paper towels. A layer at a time
  and starting with the zucchinis, fry them and the eggplants on both
  sides until lightly browned - about a minute a side. When fried, keep
  on a plate until needed. Add more oil if needed.
  
  When all are fried, sweat onions with the peppers and the garlic in
  the remaining oil in the same pan, adding further oil at the
  beginning if needed. Cover the pan and cook about 10 minutes until
  the vegetables are tender but not browned. Season to taste.
  
  Now layer the tomatoes on top of the onion pepper mixture, and season
  with salt and pepper. Cover and simmer 5 minutes or until the
  tomatoes have begun to render their juice. Uncover, baste the
  tomatoes with the juices, raise heat and boil for several minutes,
  until juice has almost entirely evaporated.
  
  Take a large fireproof casserole, and in the bottom, put 1/3 of the
  tomato mixture. Sprinkle over it 1/3 of the parsley, then layer half
  of the eggplants and zucchinis. Repeat with a second 1/3 of the
  tomato mixture, a second third of parsley and the remaining eggplants
  and zucchinis. Now cover with the remaining tomato mixture and
  parsley. Cover the casserole and simmer over low heat for 10 minutes.
  Correct seasoning, if needed. Raise heat slightly and cook uncovered
  for about 15 minutes longer, basting several times until the juices
  have evaporated, leaving a few spoonfuls of flavoured olive oil. Be
  careful of the heat, do not let the vegetables scorch in the bottom
  of the casserole.
  
  Either serve, or leave to cool. Ratatouille may be served cold or
  warm as a starter, or warm as an accompaniment to meat courses. If
  wanted warm, reheat gently just before serving time, taking care not
  to burn the vegetables.
  
  Don't be put off by the length of this recipe. It IS a fiddle, but the
  result is simply superlative. We often make the dish in double
  quantities or more and sterilise in jars.

      Title: Imam Bayaldi (Eggplant Stuffed With Aromatics)
 Categories: Main dish, Greek, Vegetarian
      Yield: 5 servings
 
  2 1/2 lb Eggplants
           Salt
      3 md Onions, peeled and sliced
    1/2 c  Water
      5 tb Olive oil
      5 ea Fresh tomatoes, peeled &
           -- sliced
    1/2 c  Parsley, chopped
      4 ea Garlic cloves, sliced
           Pepper
      1 pn Granulated sugar
           Fresh parsley for garnish
 
  Wash the eggplants, cut off the stem end if using large ones and cut
  in half lengthwise.  With the tip of a sharp knife, make at least 3
  lengthwise slashes on the cut sides of the eggplants, being careful
  not to pierce the skin on the opposite side.   Sprinkle with salt and
  let stand for 30 minutes.  Rinse with cold water, dry, and invert to
  drain.
  
  Meanwhile, put the onions in a small pan with the 1/2 cup water and
  simmer a few minutes.  Drain and discard the water or save for soup.
  
  In a medium frying pan, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil and saute the
  onions until soft, then put approximately a third of them in the
  bottom of a buttered casserole large enough to accomodate all the
  eggplants. Set 4 to 5 tomato slices over the onions in the casserole
  and add the rest of the tomatoes to the onion remaining in the frying
  pan. Saute onions and tomatoes for 10 minutes, then stir in all but 2
  tablespoons of the parsley and remove from the heat.  Set the
  eggplants into the casserole, tuck a slice of garlic into each
  eggplant slash, and stuff the slashes with the filling, allowing some
  to cover the top of the eggplant. Season lightly with salt, pepper,
  and a pinch of sugar, then dribble the remaining oil and chopped
  parsley over the eggplants. Cover the casserole with a lid or
  aluminum foil and bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 30 to 40
  minutes, until fork-tender, removing the cover during the last 10
  minutes, to allow the sauce to thicken.  Garnish with parsley and
  serve warm.
  
  Note: This is excellent as a first course of a subsequently light meal
  topped with fresh fruit and Turkish coffee.
  
  If you wish, you may leave the eggplants whole, slash one side and
  remove some of the pulp with a small spoon.  This pulp is then
  sauteed with the filing and stuffed into the eggplant, a very
  attractive method for the smaller eggplants.  As you might suspect,
  both variations may also be prepared on top of the stove.

  minutes. The polenta is done when it adheres to itself and pulls away
  from the sides of the pot, 20-25 minutes.
  
  Prepare Grilled Polenta:
  
  1. Lightly grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan with oil or butter.
  
  2. Pour the polenta into the pan and allow it to cool and solidify at
  room temperature, about 30 minutes.
  
  3. Preheat the broiler. Remove the polenta from the pan and cut into
  3/4-inch slices. Place them on a greased heatproof dish. Brush both
  sides with the oil or melted butter and broil close to the heat for a
  few minutes on each side until the polenta is crusty, about 5
  minutes. Serve immediately.

  Put 3 quarts of water in the bottom of a large stock pot with a pasta
  insert. Add the tomato liquid and tomato paste. Put all of the other
  ingredients in the pasta insert. Bring to a boil over high heat,
  lower the heat, cover and simmer for about 3 hours. Lift out the
  pasta insert, letting out the liquid fall back into the pot. Press
  down on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible and return
  all the liquid to the pot. Discard the solids.
  
  Note: This started out to be vegetable stock to use up some leftover
  stuff I had on hand, but after I strained the stock I decided to use
  it as a cooking liquid for pasta. The pasta thickened and flavored
  the stock to such an extent that I decided to save the leftovers to
  use as a tomato-vegetable soup. I may add some vegetables and small
  pasta to that.

  Dice & set aside.
  
  Cook spaghetti according to instructions, rinse, drain & set aside.
  
  Heat oil & saute onion, celery, carrots & red bell pepper in a large
  skillet until the onions are translucent, about 3 minutes.  Stir in
  the sun-dried tomatoes followed by the zucchini, eggplant, garlic,
  mushrooms, tomatoes & tofu.  Cook over a low heat until the liquid
  has evaporated.
  
  Stir in the rest of the ingredients.  Place spaghetti on a large
  serving platter, top with sauce & serve.
  
  Mark's Notes: Ensure that these vegetables are finely diced so that
  they can cook quickly & you can get a medley of tastes in your mouth.
  I do not cook the spaghetti while the sauce is cooking.  While there
  is a risk of overcooking when the vegetables are diced this small, I
  still prefer to cook my sauce, let it sit to allow the flavours to
  develop & then serve over freshly cooked pasta.  I hate cold pasta
  with hot sauces.  Also, add a handful of finely chopped fresh parsley
  just before serving.

      4 ea Garlic cloves, crushed

    1/2 ts Thyme

    1/2 c  Tomatoes, finely chopped
      3 ts Tomato paste
      1 c  Red kidney beans, soaked
      7 c  Vegetable stock
           Salt & pepper
    1/2 tb Nutritional yeast, optional+
 
  Heat oil in a large soup pot.  Stir in the onions, garlic and carrots.
  Cover & sweat over low heat for 5 minutes.  Add the chiles and herbs,
  stir well & continue to cook, covered, for a further 5 minutes.  Stir
  in the tomatoes, tomato paste & kidney beans.  Mix well, ensure that
  the heat is very low, & cook for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring
  occasionally.  Pour in the stock, season with salt & pepper & bring
  to a boil.  When at a full rolling boil, let it boil hard for 5
  minutes, then reduce the heat & simmer until the beans are tender.
  The length of time will vary, depending upon the age of the beans,
  from 50 minutes, to 2 hours.  When cooked, turn off the heat, stir in
  the nutritional yeast, if desired & let cool.
  
  Once cool, transfer the soup, in batches, to a food processor or
  blender & blend until very smooth.  Return to a clean pot & gently
  re-heat.  Serve with good, home-made bread.  It will also work with a
  good, hearty flat bread, if that's not too much of a contradiction in
  terms.  Try a Native flat bread, for example.
  
  * I'm experimenting with fresh chiles rather than dry ones, I find the
  flavour to be intense, but I find that I may be over doing the
  quantities, so reduce the amount if you prefer less hot food.  If you
  do not have fresh, a good guideline is to use dried in the following
  quantities: 1 dried chile gives a mild flavour; 2 give a medium heat;
  3 will be hot; then there's people like me & others who will go up
  from there, depending upon taste.  The trick is to use only enough
  chiles so that the other tastes are not masked.
  
  + This is optional.  It's another area of experimenting.  I find that
  a little nutritional yeast in pureed foods, or in "cream" sauces,
  gives added creaminess to dishes.  It is entirely up to the cook.

    tender, add rice or pasta and cook for one additional hour.

      2 ea Cans black beans
 1 3/16 c  Picante sauce
           Salt, to taste
           Cashew nuts, if desired
 
   Saute onions in the olive oil.  (**I used cooking wine instead to
  cut out the fat).  Add garlic a bit later.  After onion and garlic
  are have turned golden brown, add cumin, cayenne, and whatever other
  spices you might like. Fry for a couple of minutes.
  
   Next, add the peppers, saute them for a few minutes.  Put the crushed
  tomatoes, corn, beans and picante sauce into the crock pot, and add
  the onion mixture.  Cook on low about 10 hours.
  
  Serve with cashew nuts, if desired.
  
   NOTE: I didn't have room in my crockpot for 2 cans of crushed
  tomatoes, and I had to cut back a little on the corn too, so you will
  have to vary the sizes above depending on the size of your crockpot.

      Title: Warm Grapefruit and Baby Spinach Salad
 Categories: Salads, Appetizers, Fruits
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 tb Red wine vinegar
      2 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
    1/2 ts Pepper
  1 1/2 ts Butter
      1 lg Grapefruit, peeled, cut
           -- into sections & halved
      1 ts Paprika
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 lb Baby spinach leaves
 
  In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, olive oil, and pepper to
  make a vinaigrette. Set aside.
  
  In a large, nonreactive skillet over medium-high heat, melt the
  butter. When the butter begins to foam, add the grapefruit, paprika,
  and salt. Reduce the heat slightly and saute until the grapefruit is
  heated through, 2-3 min. Add the spinach leaves and gently fold them
  together with the warm fruit just long enough to wilt the spinach,
  about 45 seconds.
  
  Transfer the warm spinach-grapefruit mixture to a salad bowl and add
  the vinaigrette. Toss well and divide among 6 individual salad plates.

      Title: Kumquats in Brown Sugar and Vanilla Bean Syrup
 Categories: Side dish, Fruits, Vegetarian
      Yield: 3 quarts
 
      4 c  Whole kumquats (25-30)
      2 c  Water
      1 c  Sugar
      1 c  Brown sugar, firmly packed
      1 ea Vanilla bean
           -- halved lengthwise
 
  By cooking kumquats down with sugar and vanilla, the bitterness is
  removed from the rind and they become a tantalizing garnish or
  topping for sweet or savory dishes.
  
  Place the kumquats in a large saucepan and add water to cover. Bring
  to a full boil and, when foam begins to form on the surface, reduce
  the heat to medium. Continue to cook for 10 min more. Drain the
  kumquats and set aside.
  
  In the same saucepan over a high heat, bring the water to a gentle
  boil. Add the sugars, reduce the heat to medium, and stir constantly
  until the sugars have dissolved, about 3 min. Add the kumquats and
  vanilla bean and bring to a full boil. Reduce the heat to low and
  cook uncovered, stirring occasionally until the kumquats are
  transparent and soft, about 1 hour. Many of the kumquats will have
  burst and their skins will appear transparent.
  
  Spoon the kumquats and syrup into a clean jar, let cool, cover, and
  refrigerate. They will keep, refrigerated, for up to 2 weeks.

      2 tb Oil
      2 ea Yellow onion, sliced
      1 tb Grated lemon zest
    1/2 ts Ginger, grated
      1 c  Lemon juice
    1/2 ts Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Fresh ground pepper
      4 c  Water
      4 lg Red potatoes, boil & chop
      2 tb Italian parsley, chopped
 
  In a saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. When it begins to
  foam, add the onions, lemon zest, and ginger and saute until the
  onions are translucent, about 10 min. Add the lemon juice with sugar,
  salt and pepper; continue to saute for 2-3 min longer. Add the water,
  raise the heat to high, and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce the heat
  to medium, and simmer until the broth is golden and the onions have
  almost completely disintegrated, about 30 min.
  
  Remove from the heat and strain through a sieve into a clean
  container; discard the contents of the sieve. Working in batches if
  necessary, combine the strained stock and the potatoes in a blender
  or food processor and puree until smooth. Transfer the puree to a
  clean saucepan and bring to a gentle boil.
  
  Ladle into warmed soup bowls and garnish each serving with a little
  of the parsley.

      6 md Tomatoes, quartered
      1 md Onion, sliced
      1 md Green pepper, cut in strips
    1/4 c  Water
  1 1/2 tb Sugar

      1 lg Cucumber, sliced
    3/4 c  Cider vinegar
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
    1/8 ts Black pepper
 
  In a large bowl combine tomatoes, onion, green pepper, and cucumber.
  In a small saucepan combine vinegar, water, sugar, celery salt,
  mustard seeds, salt, cayenne pepper and black pepper.  Bring to a
  boil, boil 1 minute. Pour hot vinegar mixture over tomato mixture.
  Cover and refrigerate 8 hours or overnight to blend flavors.  Serve
  with slotted spoon.
  
  My note:  This is HOT.  Even Daryl said it was too hot!  I think
  biting into those mustard seeds really gets ya.  I'd cut the cayenne
  in half and probably the mustard seeds too.  It's very pretty to look
  at, and was a nice tomato dish to have in the dead of winter.  We
  served it with a fairly bland dish made from just some short grain
  brown rice and some peas, carrots, and corn thrown in at the end
  (frozen).

      1 tb Olive oil
      1 c  Arborio rice
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Ground black pepper
      1 c  Warm vegetable stock
      1 tb Olive oil
 
  To prepare the mushrooms:  Remove stems from mushrooms.  Set stems
  aside for mushroom broth.  Wipe the mushrooms clean with a damp
  cloth.  Combine olive oil, shallot, balsamic vinegar, salt and
  pepper.  Toss mushroom caps in the mixture to coat well.  Grill or
  broil mushrooms until tender, about 10 minutes.  Cut into nickel-size
  chunks; set aside.  (Mushrooms can be made ahead and refrigerated).
  
  To prepare mushroom broth:  Mince reserved mushroom stems; set aside.
  Saute garlic and shallot in the olive oil until translucent.  Add
  minced stems. Saute a few minutes more.  Pour in red wine and
  increase the heat, stirring until almost all the wine has evaporated.
  Add stock. Lower the heat and simmer uncovered about 25 to 30 minutes
  or until the liquid is reduced by one-fourth.  Set aside.  (Broth can
  be made ahead and refrigerated.  Reheat before using in risotto.)
  
  To prepare risotto:  Cook the onion in the oil until soft but not
  browned. Add the rice; stir until it is coated.  Cook, stirring,
  until a toasted aroma develops.  Stir in salt and pepper.  Add the
  reserved mushroom stock in several additions, stirring the rice
  frequently and letting most of the stock be absorbed before adding
  more. If you do not have enough mushroom stock, finish making risotto
  with stock.  Cook until the rice is almost tender and most of the
  liquid is absorbed.  Stir in oil and reserved mushrooms.

      1 ts Vegetable oil
    1/8 ts Salt
      2 ts Soy sauce

MMMMM-------------------------FILLING B------------------------------
      3 tb Water chestnuts, minced
      3 tb Black mushrooms, minced
           -- (presoaked)
      3 tb Bamboo shoots, minced
      3 tb Carrot, minced
      2 ts Green onion, minced
    1/2 ts Gingerroot, minced
      1 tb Soy sauce
    1/4 ts Cornstarch
  1 1/2 ts Sesame oil

MMMMM-----------------------DIPPING SAUCE----------------------------
           Soy sauce
           Mushroom soaking liquid
           Sesame oil
 
  WRAPPERS: Combine flour and hot water.  Knead a couple of minutes
  into a smooth dough; cover and let rest at least 1 hour.  Place on a
  lightly floured board, and knead for 2 minutes or so.  With palms of
  your hands, roll it into a long, cylindrical shape, 7-1/2 inches
  inches long, 1 inch in diameter.  Cut crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces;
  you will have 15.  If your climate is dry, keep the dough covered.
  Shape these, cut-side up, into a round shape. Flatten them with the
  palm or heel of your hand on a flour-dusted board. With a pastry
  roller, small rolling pin, piece of dowel, or even an empty jar --
  all of these should be wielded under the palm of your hand -- roll
  each into a round wrapper, 3-1/2 inches in diameter, thicker in the
  center, thinner toward the edge. This is easily done by rolling the
  pastry roller from the edge of the piece of dough to the center, and
  back again, turning the dough counterclockwise a little with your
  left hand after each roll. Continue all the way around several times,
  also turning the dough over once or twice, until you have a thin,
  3-1/2 inch wrapper.
  
  Prepare Filling A or B by combining the ingredients.  Place
  approximately 1 tablespoon filling on the center of each wrapper.
  Holding the wrapper on your left fingers, encircle it from below with
  your right thumb and index finger, gathering the wrapper up around
  the filling. Squeeze gently around the middle to make a kind of neck;
  some of the filling should emerge at the top.  The bundle should hold
  together securely or it will collapse during steaming. Pat the bottom
  with your left hand to make a flat base. If the skin is not too
  floppy, you can also turn the edge slightly outward (like an open
  flower), pinching it if necessary to make it secure.
  
  Place a layer of damp cloth in a bamboo steaming basket or on a flat,
  perforated race (you can use a heatproof plate if you have neither of
  these, but circulation of steam is somewhat impaired this way).
  Arrange the shao mai on it.  With the rack well above the boiling
  water in a steamer, steam for 10 minutes (if frozen, do not defrost
  first). They will stick to the cloth, but if you wash and reuse the
  same cloth each time, they will not stick as much.
  
  Serve while still hot, before the skin hardens -- as is, or with small
  dipping saucers of soy sauce and mushroom liquid (from the black
  mushrooms), mixed in equal proportions.  Add a few drops of sesame
  oil.
  
  Advance preparation: These can be assembled in advance, frozen, and
  steamed just prior to serving.

      Title: Pasta with Creole Sauce
 Categories: Main dish, Pasta, Vegetarian
      Yield: 4 servings
 
     16 oz Red kidney beans, canned
           Drained and rinsed
      2 ea Bay leaves
  1 1/2 c  Onions, diced
    1/3 c  Dry red wine
    1/2 c  Green bell pepper, thinly
           Sliced
      2 c  Canned tomato puree
      1 tb Garlic, minced
      1 tb Oregano, dried
      1 tb Thyme, dried
    1/8 ts Cayenne
      1 ts Rice wine vinegar
      8 oz Pasta
           Salt & pepper to taste
 
  Prepare the pasta per directions on the package. In a medium sauce
  pan, braise the onions in the red wine over medium high heat. When
  onions are soft, add the green pepper. Before peppers are completely
  softened, add the tomatoes, garlic, oregano, thyme, and two bay
  leaves.
  
  Stew all this together for 20 to 25 minutes.
  
  Add kidney beans, cayenne, and the rice wine vinegar.  Add salt and
  pepper to taste.  Stir well and allow to heat through. Serve sauce
  over pasta or rice.
  
  NOTES: I did not braise onions but sauteed them with the garlic in a
  little olive oil.  I did not have puree so I used 16 oz can of diced
  tomatoes processed in a food processor and added an 8 oz can of
  tomato sauce. I brought the sauce to a boil, lowered heat and cooked
  for about 1 1/2 hours.

      Title: Foccacia
 Categories: Bakery, Italian, Breads, Lunch, Vegetarian
      Yield: 1 foccacia
 
    1/4 oz Dry yeast
  1 1/4 c  Warm water
      1 ts Brown rice syrup
  1 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
  1 1/4 c  All purpose flour
    3/4 ts Salt
    1/3 c  Olive oil
           Cornmeal
      4 ea Garlic cloves
           Salt & pepper
  1 1/2 c  Mushrooms, sliced
      1 c  Red onions, sliced
      1 tb Thyme, chopped
 
  Dissolve the yeast in the warm water, along with the rice syrup.  Let
  stand until the yeast begins to foam.
  
  In a mixing bowl, combine the flours & salt.  Add 2 tb of olive oil&
  knead into a ball.  Continue to knead until the dough is elastic.
  Place dough in an oiled bowl & loosely cover with a damp towel.  Let
  rise until doubled in bulk.  Press down.  Roll out to form a 12"
  round (or to fit on your cookie sheet).  Sprinkle the pizza tin or
  baking stone or cookie sheet with cornmeal & slide dough on to it.
  Pinch up the edges & brush with olive oil.
  
  While the dough is rising, toss the garlic with a little olive oil,
  salt & pepper.  Spread them on a cookie sheet & roast in an oven
  preheated to 350F, until they are soft: about 45 minutes.  Cool,
  remove skins & slice.
  
  Saute the mushrooms & onions in 1 tb olive oil for 3 to 5 minutes.
  Sprinkle over the dough with the garlic cloves & thyme.  Bake in a
  375F oven for 15 to 20 minutes.

      Yield: 1 foccacia
 
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
    1/2 tb Yeast
      1 c  Lukewarm water
    1/2 ts Sugar
      1 ts Salt
      2 ts Rosemary, ground
      1 tb Olive oil
      1 tb Wheat germ
      3 c  Flour

MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
      3 md Onions, diced
  1 1/2 tb Olive oil
           Salt & pepper
           Olive oil, for brushing
 
  In a mixing bowl, combine the yeast, water, sugar, salt, oil &
  rosemary. Let stand until the yeast starts to froth.  Mix in the
  wheat germ & 1 c flour.  Beat well & let sit for 5 minutes.  Knead in
  the remaining flour & knead until the dough is soft & pliable.
  Lightly oil a clean bowl & cover with a towel.  Let rise until
  doubled in bulk.
  
  Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet & saute the onions, reduce
  heat to low & cook until the onions begin to caramelize.  Remove from
  heat & set aside.  Preheat oven to 350F.
  
  Roll out the dough to fit into a cookie sheet or on a pizza stone.
  Lightly sprinkle the cookie sheet with cornmeal & place the dough on
  the sheet.  Stretch into the corners & build up the edges slightly.
  Let rest for 10 minutes.
  
  Brush the dough with olive oil & spread the onions over the top.
  Generously salt & grind fresh black pepper over the top.  Bake for 25
  minutes or until the crusts are done.  Cut up & serve immediately or
  let cool.  This is equally good cold & served at room temperature.
  
  NOTE: I thought this recipe was from "Friendly Foods" by Ron
  Pickarski, & it is not.  It is also not in Carol Field's "Italy in
  Small Bites", so if someone has the source for this recipe I'll
  gladly give it the credit.  In the meantime, this is what I do for
  onion foccacia & I guess it comes from my head each time.

  NOTE: I think that this recipe still needs something to pick it up a
  little if you have any ideas, please let me know.  It is based on a
  recipe a friend of mine ordered in Glasgow in an Italian Restaurant,
  she apparently orders it a lot, I had never seen it before.  There is
  a lot of starch, but don't let that put you off.  I found it better
  cold than hot, but that may be my preference.
